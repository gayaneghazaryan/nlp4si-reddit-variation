7f2slj,7f2slj,Passedaschoolbus,"Hi, im sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i have been anxious about it since its happened. I live in Canada Ontario. As i was coming home from work a school bus on the opposite end of the road started flashing its lights. I didnt notice and panicked at the last moment passing it and coming to a stop after passing it. The bus driver honked at me and after stopping i moved on. I have been nervous all day as to whether i will recieve a ticket and what the severity of what i have done is. I passed it while the bus was still moving and didnt have its stop sign down. Is there a chance i can get my license suspended. Im on a G2. Sorry if this isnt the right place for this but im looking for any advice i can get. Thanks you so much",l
c3r6uux,pp8c9,r_ocketskates,"I'd say the biggest problem here is that the relationship becomes all about her, and not about both of you. There is the problem of this not only being a girl you clearly care about a great deal, but one you're also worried for. This can often make you disregard your own happiness/security/sanity to concentrate on their wellbeing. Believe me when I say I can relate to your situation. The bottom line is that you being with her isn't stopping her feeling suicidal, so whether you are there or not, that problem will remain within her. Has she been receiving any professional help?",r

ojhlc,ojhlc,TehEmperorOfLulz,"(This is a direct copy/paste off the Yahoo Answers question i've already posted. I'm posting here aswell as the general quality of r/relationshipadvice seems to be much higher than Y!A)  Some of you may have read the question i gave you about a week ago, named:  ""Be honest: Do you think she likes me?""  So the collected answer seemed to be a big YES, and i was very reliefed, but not quite sure yet. So i decided to see what the people over at r/relationshipadvice had in store for me, and they had the same general answer, but with a bit more filling on the answers. (Links will be in the Additional details)  So, one of the people on reddit said: ""She definitely likes you. Go easy but do it very soon. A kiss after the movies is enough to trigger it."", and another said ""...waiting for you to make a move for 4 months. Sillyhead.""  So, as you can see, one of them is telling me she still likes me, and i should just go for a kiss after the movies, while another says i blew it.  So if i were to go with the assumption that she still likes me, and perhaps going with the idea of it happening at the movies. Do you believe that the kiss would be a fine idea, or is it perhaps a bit too rushed and silly?  If not, what else should i do? I really hope that you can help me here:) I would love to see some long, well thought out answers, but that is ofcourse not a must:)    EDIT: About the movie, we both currently are overloaded with homework, so it will probably first be in 3-4 weeks as far as i know. Should i wait until then, or take the tasteless, but working ""I love you!"" On skype/sms?

1bz9ko,1bz9ko,,"So I've known my boyfriend for almost 3 1/2 years. We've been together and living together for almost 1 1/2 years. We had an extremely rocky history. 3 1/2 years ago we were dating for a few months and I found out he had another girlfriend. He was playing both of us for 2 months. I was extremely depressed for awhile but he kept coming back to me. I stayed his friend and during this time he told me to go kill myself and put a picture of my boobs(the only skin showing was cleavage but I have big boobs) along with my number on the Internet(I'm assuming this was all to prove his loyalty to the other girlfriend). I stopped talking to him but then his sister passed away and he asked me to go to the funeral for emotional support. I agreed because I still cared about him. At the time I was dating and completely in love with a marine so nothing happened. A few months after that we ended up getting dumped at the same time and decided to hang out which we then had sex for the first time with each other. We decided to try to date again(my self esteem was fucked by this point). A couple of weeks later he dumps me and says he has to much going on right now. I was furious. In may of '11 I went to see his graduation and go to the party his family was throwing. On the drive there in his truck he tells me the reason he had to break up with me is because he got a 13 year old pregnant. The poor girl ended up having to get an abortion. Anyways the whole time at the party I was there..by myself..I got my parents to drive 6 hours so I could watch this asshole hang out with his 13 year old chick..I was beyond furious..after all that he said he didn't wanna talk to me ever again so my parents got to see me cry like a dumbass outside our motel..yay..well anyways in December of '11 I needed to move out of my parents house for personal reasons. I called him out of the blue and asked if he could help. He agreed and when I got to his apartment he told me his girl dumped him again(I forgot to mention the girl he cheated on me with in the beginning was always getting with him then dumping him like every week). Well us being in an apartment together and having a history started things and I wasn't planning on making a relationship out of it for obvious reasons but he begged and begged. Then his ex found out and she begged him to take her back and he was begging me to take him back and I was just like ""I don't even love you. Get back with her. This was a mistake"" but he didn't accept that. It took a lot of drama but he finally pushed her out of his life and I agreed to be with him( I figured he would fuck up..but he hasn't yet). Its been a year and now I'm attached to him again. I love him and all but I get angry with him easily. I'm almost constantly depressed. He hasn't done anything wrong lately at all. He's changed but I still feel a lot if animosity. I mean stupidly enough I've forgiven him but I feel like subconsciously I can't ever fall in love with him or get to close. He's helped me out a lot this passed year but :/..I just can't..any advice? Should I keep trying? Sorry for the damn book I just wrote.",r

c450abq,rd9ja,Spitfirre,"Along with what everyone else has said, I'll reiterate: It will get better.  Secondly, you aren't alone. College is a huge leap into adulthood, and with it comes sacrifice and new experiences. This happens to many couples, and it causes a lot of missed opportunities. I had a really bad breakup in August, and it fucking ruined me. For the following semester, I had no passion, no drive, and just was empty.  I saw her over winter break, and it cut even deeper that she had moved on so easily, where I think it was obvious I was getting choked up just sitting with her.  Then it hit me: Fill the void. This current semester at school I immersed myself into a school club, picked up some other things, and work my ass off. It really helps, trust me. If you have no significant down-time, you have a lot less time feeling badly about what happened.  Now if you asked me ""Spitfirre, are you happy?"" I would respond with ""Barely."" I *HATE* being alone. I can't stand going to bed with nothing next to me. It still sucks, but it's easier to cope with now that I have a thousand distractions.  What helped me with my coping was three things:  * A daily plan written in  black sharpie, pinned to the wall next to my head in bed. The satisfaction of completing even half those items works *  An idol to try and become. I found a few significant figures in the world and tried to emulate their philosophies. Neil Degrasse Tyson is one. * A good group of friends. Being alone is horrible, but trying to cope with it alone is worse. You start blaming yourself, cutting at your life, and just wallowing in self pity. I did the same, but with a fifth of tequila every weekend or so. I would suggest against that.  Chin up buddy, you sound like an okay guy, and you just entered college. You have your whole life ahead of you. I'm 20, and I've been single for 95% of my life. Everyone tells me that I'll make the perfect boyfriend, so naturally I get pissed that I don't find someone who wants me.

qa7bi,qa7bi,ldr_throwaway1,"Ok redditors, I trust you guys and could use a bit of advice now. I dated a girl for a couple years starting back in 2008. I met her in Ireland and she was the love of my life. You absolutely couldn't separate us and we lived together in Ireland for 6 months or so. It was a study abroad program for school, and after it was over she moved back to Colorado, and I to Michigan.   We kept dating and we were able to see each other at least monthly.  However, things went downhill quickly and she ended up cheating on me at which point the relationship naturally ended. I never got to see her again after that and I hate how things ended between us.   Its been a couple years since then, and she recently got engaged and I'm sure she's very happy. My predicament is that I am in Colorado for work for a few weeks only a few miles from where she lives. Would it be weird for me to get ahold of her and try and catch up? I haven't talked to her since we broke up and I don't know what the etiquette is for seeing an ex-girlfriend. Anyone been on the other side of this equation?

1f57dr,1f57dr,innocuousleveller,"I'm just going to launch right in, as I'm not sure if background is necessary or will just add to the word count.  Over the past three months I have got to know a girl. We have some mutual friends and had spoken a little at a few parties over the past year, but only started seeing each other regularly since February when at one of these she asked me to go to lunch with her. Basically since then things have been going great, we do things together often and communicate very frequently in between activities. She initiates contact as much as I do (which is a lot) which is reassuring in some way.  Since becoming friends with her I've been developing an increasing attachment; I really like listening to the things she tells me and telling her things, and feel like I care about her quite a lot. The best description I can think of is that I have an intense interest in her.  Basically I want to progress past friendship with her, but have no idea if I should try, how to try, or how to gauge her feelings at all. I just literally have no idea.  Now here comes the twist, the reason why this would fit in on Jeremy Kyle, Oprah, or whatever equivalent to those silly things exists in your country. This girl has been involved with one of my friends. They were together most prominently about a year ago, and seemed to be in a relationship sort-of for ages (by sort of I mean that they rarely saw one another or talked but were still together).   Now I don't even really know if this is still a thing, if she feels anything the same as me (past wanting to be friends), or if this is something I should even be hoping will happen. I am very afraid that being around her but not being able to be with her in this way will make me miserable.  Not sure if it matters at all, but I have Asperger's Syndrome and mostly find these things very difficult.  Any advice or help would be much appreciated, and sorry if I could've been more concise.",r

19igwk,19igwk,,"Dear Reddit,  So apparently I am ""naturally flirt"" and it's causing issues in my relationship.  My boyfriend and I are having trust issues. He'll be leaving for the military soon and we're going to try our hand at a LDR. Here's the problem though- he doesn't trust me because I am ""naturally flirty"".   In all honesty I hadn't ever considered it flirting, only politeness, but despite the definition he's uncomfortable with the way I act around others. But I'm willing to change  it. I really am.  The problem is since our definitions aren't aligned I do things that he considers flirting and gets angry at that I was unaware of. I've become very conscious about the way I sit, walk, talk, stand, laugh/smile, where my eyes rest/roam, etc. and in my opinion I'm doing a pretty good job. I'm really really trying to be repressed, even if it means being ""impolite"" to people, because I don't want him to be uncomfortable with how I am.   But try as I do he keeps blowing up about these really small things.  Like in a restaurant today he thinks I was acting flirty because an elderly guy (he really was old) nodded and offered a hello to me as I was passing. I had not interacted with or even seen this guy before passing him, but my boyfriend is convinced I would have had to do something to make him speak to me.  Then later this evening  we went to a movie and it was located directly next to a shop where a bunch of our friends gather for card games, so I suggested we walk over to say hi. But he got mad thinking its because I'm interested in a guy there, when in all full and complete honesty- I'm not. I just thought it could be fun.  But he doesn't believe me and anytime I talk to him about it he brings up a ton of other things that bothers him that I do, but they start getting ridiculous.  Once again, I am willing to and I'm trying to change. Never do I intentionally do anything ""flirty"" and I've been careful to not do the things he's pointed out to me. But it's not helping.   Is he just insecure? Jealous of any attention he isn't getting? Am I being wrong? How do I handle this?  Thanks!",r

Please advise.**  Original Post:   &gt; I hope this is the right sub, if not apologies and please advice otherwise.  &gt; I just moved in to this complex on July, 14th.  &gt; As the title says, my apartment has been out of power for the entire complex, 23 floors.  &gt; It started July 20, 2017 at approximately 4:00 pm. Per management, the outage is due to a transformer exploding in the basement resulting in flooding and damage the gearbox. No details given will it will be restored and management is not easily accessible.  &gt; July 21, 2017, Outage continued.  &gt; Tenants have been told eight different times when the power would be restored, two of which have been in writing and posted throughout the complex, other times mentioned have been verbal via management. Signage posted also asks tenants to stay elsewhere.  &gt; I stayed with a friend for the night.  &gt; July 22, 2017, Outage continued.  &gt; I returned about 7:00am to the complex and the power is still off, as I'm typing this. Management is not on the property and the last update is signage noting the details of what happened and giving a time frame of restored power at 6:00pm on the 21st. The last update on their Facebook page was at 10:10pm noting the same at the signage.  &gt;  &gt; Also to note, this is in the South where average temp is running 85-95 degrees.  &gt;  &gt; My question, what can I do at this point, if anything? I just signed my lease on July 14th is there any circumstance where this would be grounds to terminate it and move elsewhere? I'm trying to be level headed about this but I'm going into my first year of teaching. Patience and understanding is running on fumes for me at this point.  &gt; I've documented everything and taken pictures of the signage. Is there anything else I should do?  &gt;  &gt; Thank you and I appreciate the time.      --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",l

kjmjk,kjmjk,relationshipadvice22,"I am mid 20's, she is later 20's We were together for over 2 years, almost 3, she was the first of my serious relationships that I can say I honestly loved. We had our ups and downs but that happens, we were always able to work them out. We went through a whole lot together, lived together for most of the relationship. We had always talked about moving and I told her that when she was ready to move that I would be more than happy to go with. Well the time came that she was ready to move to be closer to her family and she told me that she was going to move. She didn't ask me to move or anything and had planned to move there alone, she stated that she was unhappy with making me leave everything (job, family, friends). In the few months up to the move we talked about LD and we both stated we would be willing to give it a shot. 2 weeks before she moved she stated that when she moves she wants to be single. She said that she wants to be alone so she can find herself and get back to being her. It hurt, a lot. The 2 weeks before she moved she stayed with a friend so it would be easier to say goodbye, we still talked and hung out a couple times in those 2 weeks. The day before she left we hung out all day, reminisced about the past years, all the good times as that's what we wanted to remember, what we would miss about each other.  2 weeks after she moved we were messaging back and forth and she had told me that she was hanging out with a mutual friend. I was pretty hurt by this because they have lots in common and I got upset and flat out asked her if there was anything between them and she told me that she was attracted to him.  I tried to push her out of my mind and tell myself that it's none of my business anymore but I find myself thinking about them. She says there is nothing going on between them, that they are just friends but that she wouldn't say no if it were to go further. Hearing this makes my stomach turn because we have mutual friends and I know that I wouldn't be able to handle seeing them together.  It has been a month since she has left. I do still love her and I miss her everyday but I'm trying to move on. I don't message her unless she messages me, I still can't seem to shake the thought of them together even though she says they are just friends. I am unable to cut all contact with her as we have financial investments together otherwise I would as I know that is the best thing to do.",r

I asked when this would be paid, but I was told that invoices are given a month in advance of payment so any correction can be made. At the start of the next month, I had still received no money. I stopped doing work for them as I was under a lot of stress of figuring out how to pay rent and also studying for my uni exams. Now that I've got things under control I'm ready to  tackle this issue.  What steps can I take to get this company to pay me the money that they owe me. I have records of the amount they owe me, and asking kindly has not seemed to work at all. I found other people online who said this company was poor with their payments, but I was desperate for work so I had to take it. I feel as if I have no negotiating power with this company and they have no reason to pay me for the work I've done.",l

She HAS lived in a dorm, but her parents paid for that, she has never had to pay rent before, I have lived on my own since the month I turned 18.  I make about 1,500 a month and where I live costs $550 a month. Girlfriend makes about 1,400 a month but in a couple months she is getting a job making about $3k a month.  Due to insurance and everything my expenses total about $1,100 a month. Due to a break in and a mugging (involving a gun!) I have decided it's time to move out. Unfortunately there's nowhere nearby for less than $750 a month which would raise my monthly expenses to ~1,400 which is absolutely unacceptable as it would leave me nothing in savings.  We found an amazing duplex, 1,300 sq feet, 2 car garage, 2 bedroom finished basement, $83,000. Monthly payments come out to $850 a month. She said if I get the place she will move in with me so we can afford it.  Now that everything is about finalized, she doesn't want to move in. She wants to continue living with her parents until she has enough saved up to afford furniture, a new bed, tv, desk, bookshelves etc. I think she said she wants to save up like $5k which wouldn't be until about May.  Here's the problem, I can't afford to live there alone. But she says it would be stupid for her to move in before she has savings because she doesn't want to live paycheck to paycheck, which is what she's forcing me to do!

She goes to a college a few hours away from mine, and because her parents are overprotective, she cannot drive or otherwise see me. i take the drive to see her and spend time with her when i have a free day every week, and see her at her house on the weekends. overall it could be better, but i can live with it. however we each have our own problems, i have mild depression and anger problems, and she is very jealous if i do anything without her. if i were to see some old friends and go out to a movie with them, go to a class reunion, or have a night with the guys, she will become jealous, and stop talking. she will play dumb but a fight usually happens next when i ask why she is mad. i recognize my attitude probably does make things worse i love her, and we have talked about it, and though we have promised to stop our arguments, it hasn't happened. i cannot go do anything even spending a vacation with family without her mood turning sour and pouting. if i ever tell her about my plans that night, her entire mood will change on both phone and text to become very negative. it has reached the point i have to have normal social interaction in secret to avoid the fights. if we ever do talk about it, she says she feels as if she isnt as important as my friends are, because we can hang out at night at any time, and i dont do that with her. the whole reason i cant do that with her is because of her family, and she isnt making any effort to learn to drive or live on her own at all (mostly because the parents dont let her, even though she is an adult.) reddit, i love her, she probably loves me more, but it would kill me to lose her over something this stupid. i need help.",r

rp2k1,rp2k1,whatdo412012,"21/F - Long story short, my boyfriend (of almost two years) and I split two months before we are supposed to be graduating. It was a long time coming and a situation where we both began realizing the differences we had in relationship-expectations. We had originally decided that we'd just try to take it easy until we graduate; enjoy our time with each other before we moved away, but the gap became too difficult to bridge.    We still definitely have feelings for each other (I would even go so far as to say that we still love each other), even if we've both realized that this relationship (bf/gf) is not working at all anymore. We're not on bad terms (i.e. we're not hostile at all), but I think we're both still unsure of how to deal with this situation... It's also still relatively fresh (3-4 days), and I know that I burst into tears anytime I spend more than 5 minutes talking to him. Right now, we're living in a house with 5 other mutual, good friends, but ... we've broken up.   He and I both know that time apart and space between us is ideal, but it is almost impossible to share our current living arrangement without talking/seeing each other everyday. It's far too little time to move out, and neither of us wants to make it intensely awkward with our group of friends who are also graduating...    I guess what I had questions about is -- looking at our situation, I'd much rather just hang out and do things with him as a friend (we were really good friends before dating) than sit around feeling like shit, miss him like crazy, and avoid him. I know the awkward shuffle-evasion is necessary just to calm down and probably the right thing to do... right? Is there another way to go about this?    What do?? Thank you, wonderful people, for any advice/scolding/lecturing/hand-holding in advance!   **TLDR;** bf and I are living together with other friends. We used to be great friends, still love each other, but can't do the non-platonic. We're two months away from graduating. How do I make life not-hell for all of us?  Edit: formatting",r

gfci8,gfci8,throwaway819432,"Alright so. I dated a girl back in high school (now in college). And things were incredible when it happened. Dated for about 8-9 months (honestly don't remember at this point) when my jealousy issues pretty much caused a breakup. I was a wreck, but pretty much pulled it together and overall grew from the situation.  Fast forward a couple years, met a girl in college, started dating and we still are - more than a year, year and a half at this point. And I end up going to the same college as my high school girlfriend.  Let me make sure I'm semi-clear about this. My high school girlfriend, as I remember it, was incredible. We had a lot of fun together, I loved hanging out with her, and it might've just been high school hormones but I dare say I was in love with her. Was just discussing a couple weeks ago with my best friend about how I miss her.  So she's recently resurfaced in my life (by recently I mean we just started talking again) and I can feel these feelings for her resurfacing. She has a boyfriend hell, I have a girlfriend (would never cheat ever), but I can't stop just imagining ""what ifs"" with her.  I seriously have no idea what to do and how to feel right now about any of this. I figure I have a few options.  * I break up with my current girlfriend and actively pursue my old girlfriend. * I go ahead and stay with my current girlfriend and either a. cut off contact with my old girlfriend or b. stay as close friends. I'm just worried about jealousy and trust issues with my current girlfriend. * I break up with my current girlfriend because of these doubts (and the fact that these doubts I have may mean I'm not serious enough about the relationship) and whatever happens with my old girlfriend happens.

8fmoj7,8fmoj7,bing320727,"TL;DR: Bee hive damage wasn’t disclosed by seller or on inspection report. We found dead hive and holes in ceiling a week after closing.  Location: King county, WA, USA   My dad bought a house outside Seattle this month. Deal closed last week. He works overseas and I work in another state so we relied heavily on an agent (different from seller’s agent) during the process. Neither my dad or I had set foot on the property before the deal closed. The seller is over 80 years old and already moved into a local nursing home, he also had an inspection report prepared. Since Seattle’s housing market is very competitive and bidding war happened to my dad many times before, causing him to miss on his dream homes, my dad relied on the inspection report the seller provided instead of ordering his own inspection service. This turns out to be a big mistake.   This week I had the chance to visit the house. I noticed something obviously wrong with the ceiling and walls of a bedroom, and to my horror, found out there is a massive bee hive in the wall.... The bees don’t appear to be alive anymore. However it seems they chewed through the walls and ceiling and inevitably left holes to be repaired. I’m no expert in bees, but I believe it indicates that the hives had been there for quite a while and it is impossible that the seller/agent/inspector weren’t aware of the problem. The estimated cost to repair is &gt;1% of the closing price (1 million+).   Now I realize that my dad might just have to suck it up because the contract is closed. But given the magnitude of the issue and high likelihood that the seller/seller agent intentionally deceived us by leaving the problem out of the inspection report, I think it is worth putting up a fight to recover some cost. We can really use some advice on how to take action from here. Folks with knowledge/experience in the field, thank you in advance!

d0cywm5,47e8al,ProsperosShadow,"I think I have a unique and pretty knowledgable take on this one for two reasons: 1) I also have had a criminal case (DUI) that was expunged; and 2) I actually now conduct in depth background investigations for a major corporate firm, investigating all kinds of people at any level for a variety of reasons.  I've learned a great deal about these kind of things at this point. Relevant to you: nothing is ever truly ever expunged if someone is looking for it. My record has been fully expunged, and it didn't come up in my standard background check while I was applying for my job. It's also not relevant to my job. Companies doing a cheap, standard criminal record check will not necessarily see your record on first glance, and for most, that's enough.  That said, unfortunately, nothing is truly ever expunged when someone is digging deep. I have found and reported on many cases/incidents that are technically non-existent, records-wise. If I find an archived arrest record in a proprietary database, I may not be able to find a court case directly, but there are other ways. Granted, if someone was arrested for underage drinking or open container or even DUIs, generally speaking, it's not something that would affect their job in my industry. If I report  these (in the case that it is relevant for some reason) I always do so noting their age, and/or noting that it has been fully expunged.   I have found a number of incidents where records are expunged, but the issue is important/ relevant, in which case I dig and dig till I find more. For example, one person my firm was considering doing business with had an archived arrest record in Westlaw for ""forgery"" in the 90s where all records and court documents were destroyed because it was expunged. Since a charge like that needs to be fleshed out and probably known by my company before doing business with them, I researched the hell out of it, and found an archived blurb in a college newspaper that reported the arrest and charges. Turned out to be a quite serious kind of forgery, making false passports and documents fraud, with the equipment and skills do to so. The case was expunged thanks to wealthy parents, but certainly worth my company knowing before conducting any  business.  Point is, if it's small enough and expunged, people won't care. If it's big or relevant enough that people will dig for something, a good investigator can and will find anything. 90% of the time this won't be the case and people won't search this way. I just wanted to point out that no matter what you pay or agencies you report things like this to, there are always ways to find it anyway through other means, if looking.",l

c448b64,r28t6,coldfire17,"I think the first step is to figure out why you have trouble trusting. If your significant other has never cheated or given you actual reason to think they would cheat, the problem usually is with you. You have to examine your feelings about romantic partners and people in general. Ask yourself if you have problems trusting people to not try to hurt you in general or if it's specific to romantic partners. Either way, you may want to consider outside resources such as therapy if this becomes a true stumbling block for you. Trust is paramount in romantic relationships and if you are unable to trust your partner you will destroy the relationship eventually. Ideally, you should be able to trust that your partner would never try to intentionally hurt you, and that they would do what they can (within reason) to not unintentionally hurt you. But it also definitely helps to make sure that your understandings of what is and isn't reasonable to expect behavior-wise is checked first.",r

I'd been doing so well boyfriend and I were considering going to our favorite brewery for their Christmas ale. Well, last night on my lunch hour I ate at the bar next to my work (it's the only place that sells food and I forgot my lunch). They had the Christmas ale on tap, and I stupidly thought ""oh, what the hell, even (boyfriend's name) thinks I might be ready.""   My food ended up being really gross, so I didn't eat any of it. I ended up drinking the tall beer on an empty stomach, and having a shot which someone bought me. The beer was really strong (8%) and my tolerance was low from not drinking for months, needless to say I ended up getting a bit drunk. It affected me in a way I've never been affected by alcohol in a long, long time.  I ended up getting really upset that I'd had such a horrible lapse of judgment, and was crying when my boyfriend picked me up from work about 2 hours later (still drunkish at this point). I told him what was going on, and when we got back to his house he said he needed to be alone to think about what happened. Then he took my phone and said he'd keep it since he'd lent me the money for it. I could have it back when I paid him for it. Well, for some reason I ended up freaking out. I guess I was really upset and just wanted to be comforted (I've had to comfort him/put up with pissy behavior during his depression), although I had no right to expect boyfriend to do it considering the circumstances. A bit of fighting later, boyfriend makes some kind of insult about my drinking and I just lose it and lunge after him. He then tells me to leave or he would call the cops. I do. I was really mad about the insult, I would never have made fun of his depression. That doesn't justify the attack though.  As you can probably guess, he wants to break up with me now, although we talked on the phone for a while last night and we did end the call on a good note (and later made jokes about being sad on twitter). Basically, what should I do? Is there anything I can do to fix this? I seriously screwed up.

My family is not American though we live in the states and it's kind of taboo to come back to my parents house with a girl.

I started college not only a virgin, but without ever having my first kiss.   I think girls generally find me attractive, I'm pretty fit, and I'm also not an asshole, so it didn't take much time before I was making out with all kinds of girls at parties on campus, but I was still not confident enough to kiss a girl sober or even initiate that sort of thing. And I most definitely did not know at all how to go about trying to lose my virginity.

Done, on to the problem. ----  My freshman year of college, I met a girl, also freshman. She was objectively very attractive and I was immediately drawn to her. I had **never** done this in my life, but I basically asked her out on a date, my fan irst in life. The date went well, as did the next two or three. Insecurity began to mount, as my guy friends (some horny bastards that are always fucking somebody) would give me all kinds of macho advice with what to do with her. I tried to stay cool and play it by ear, thinking she was a nice girl.  Fast forward to the Spring of freshman year (I can fill in details of in between if you ask). I'm head over heels in love with this girl and want to date her rather than just fuck. We've slept in the same bed at least three times by now, gone to my formal together, and we talk every day. After a while, I mustered up the courage to.... accidentally frustrate and by talking about her so much that he indirectly asked her out for me. She told him that things were complicated and they didn't need to get more complicated. ""Uh-oh"".   I soon found out from another ""friend"" who was very manipulative that over the last several months, she had fucked at least seven different guys, two of them being friends of mine I introduced her to. Long story short, I forgave one of them, I had nothing to be mad about because I can't claim a girl I'm not dating, but the other guy I disliked for that and other things he had done in the past. I had a serious grudge with him. Unfortunately, he was the one she decided to keep fucking with.   I was still in love with her though angry at her from the end of freshman year until the middle of sophomore year. She got more serious with the other guy and I decided that she was retarded and I just wanted to fuck her and get it out of my system. We started getting close again and just when I think things are going back to how they were, she starts actually dating the other guy, who treated her and another one of my friends he had dated before like shit. I was disappointed in her for staying with a guy like that and I basically cut her off.  Over the next summer, while in an on again off again relationship with dude, she would text once every month and a half or so to tell me she had a a dream about me or something. By that point, I wanted to have nothing to do with her, but I definitely still had unresolved feelings for her so I remained cordial but terse with my responses.  Junior year of college she had been broken up with the other guy for a while and we made up, acknowledging that it was really weird not talking to each other like before. At this point, I decided that I actually *did* want to just be friends with her, but if we ended up fucking at some point, I wouldn't mind. We grew closer and closer throughout the school year to the point that we became more or less best friends.   This is the tricky part. We are very very good friends and tell each other almost everything, but there is still the issue of unresolved relationship issues and obvious mutual attraction. Up until this school year, the most I had done was probably hug her or something. This year, we partied together a lot and she's flashed me, we've drunkenly made out once, kissed twice, and messed around a little (2nd base?), but I still can't tell if she likes me or not. Am I in a very weird friend zone? If so, should I get out of it?",r

c3whje3,qcck8,staybrutal,"I used to be a very jealous woman. I think most of it was a combination of youth, immaturity, and being new at relationships. I had no idea how to navigate other people within a relationship. I had my head stuck so far up my boyfriend's ass that I went ballistic if he hung out with his guy friends for ""too long"" (which was arbitrary depending on my emotions). Or, if he talked about a female classmate at all would drive me to tears of rage.  Anyway, I learned the hard way that the jealousy was making both of us miserable. It took a while and a little growing up to get over it. I really had to stop myself in my jealous thoughts and get through it before talking to the bf. After I let myself feel the feelings, analyze exactly what I was afraid of and determine how likely any of those fears would be realized, I usually calmed down enough to return to rationality.  It's a process. Start small. Don't freak out on impulse. If it's really, really starting to become abusive or stalkerish or violent, then please do seek professional help.

omwlk,omwlk,confusedabout2,"Forewarning, this is long. I also use a shit ton of parenthesis. That'll surely bother someone, so I apologize. Background-I am a 19 year old, nearly 20 male college student. I've been in several relationships throughout my life starting in high school (officially dated 3 girls, have been in monogamous ""relationships"" with 3 others, not including random hookups). Last semester at the beginning of my sophomore year I randomly met a girl in one of my classes (engineering physics II, finding a cute girl in that type of class is rare). Let's call her K. I'd thought she was cute, and did kind of want to approach her but I'm not particularly aggressive when it comes to approaching random girls. An opportunity arose for us to speak and when it did I took my chance.  Over the next several months we became pretty decent friends and starting hanging out frequently (school football games, went out on the weekends, grabbed food a lot, etc). I was fairly attracted to her and when it came to getting to know her, I'll admit I was fairly smitten. Out of all my relationships I'd never really, truly known the person I was dating except maybe one of them (the longest one) and really genuinely liked her as a person in almost every way. This never happened to me before, where I really had feelings for someone before I was anything with them.   Unfortunately as we became closer and more flirty, she dropped on me that she had (I'm saying had because it is no longer the case) a boyfriend. It hurt a little bit, especially since the same day an ex of mine began begging me to get back with her (that went on for quite some time but has since been resolved 100% so it's irrelevant), but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle; I consider myself generally strong willed emotionally.   We went on being friends for a while until one night after one of our home football games she had a gathering at her house of some of her out of town friends, her sister and her sister's friends. That night from an angry drunken exchange between her and her sister I found out some things about her relationship. Keep in mind, she's 19. Her (now ex) boyfriend is 31. I found out several weeks later when I went to talk to her about our relationship that he is also divorced, has two children ages 12 and 10 and carries 42 misdemeanors (aka jail time). He also isn't particularly doing anything with his life as he works at a golf course (where he and she met, since she also works there).   They dated for ~3 months and he broke up with her (towards the end of November). Being that 3 months is still that falling in love stage, she was obviously devastated and never really got any closure. In fact, when she was home over break we got into a drunken argument on New Year's (we don't live in the same state, merely attend the same school) she told me he still tells her he loves her and she's still in love with him even though they are not together and will not get back together. To make matters worse, she's only been in 3 relationships-and before this one, she had never been the one to be dumped. Getting dumped the first time is absolutely crushing and just making things harder here. Essentially that makes it impossible for us to be anything right now, which should be fairly obvious.  The only problem-it's killing me. I really, truly, genuinely like this girl like I have no other girl. I shouldn't, considering she's obviously very naive and foolish when it comes to relationships (at least that's my opinion) and most of my friends believe that she's ""poisonous"" to me in a sense (not as a person but in a relationship sense). I'd love to just get rid of her out of my life, but it's nigh impossible. Not only has she become such a big part of my life, but I can't really escape her-we're in 2 classes together which puts us in class together all 5 days of the school week. I'm also pretty much one of the only people she hangs out with at school anymore (there was a whole debacle last year with her friends getting mad at her for choosing to live with her roommate off campus this year, lost the rest of her friends when her and her ex from last year broke up, etc) and I almost don't have it in me to just cut her out of my life when she has nothing else to go to. It's really been hurting me lately (hell she and I just had dinner together tonight) but I really can't justify not being her friend when in all reality...she hasn't done anything to me. These feelings are my own.  Now at this point you're probably saying ""the title said there are 2 girls!"". Well, you'd be correct. Let's call her J. J is a very, very close friend of mine from school who I met before school even started last year. She's very coveted around school-so much so that there are an inordinate number of guys trying to sleep with her constantly (turn off? Little bit). I did have a bit of an interest in her last year, but it never developed. Until...this past weekend. We ended up coming back to my apartment after being out and one thing led to another and I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. Recently (even before that) she had been acting in a ""more than friends"" way with me with constant wanting to hang out and be alone with me that never had been there before. It's even more so after our night spent together. While I had that interest in her a long time ago, it's just not there. And I'm concerned that she's moving more towards that while I have no interest in that-sure I can say no, but it's an extra burden to deal with while I'm still dealing with K.  Until today I thought I was handling these situations well enough to get by easily enough. After I got home from dinner with K, shit just ""hit"" me. I'm miserable. I have been for a long time knowing K and J certainly isn't helping when I'm in this position. So Reddit, is there ANYTHING I can do here?",r

1jezou,1jezou,,"Hey everyone, This is my first actual posting so forgive me if I haven't quite worked out the website. Back story to start with, my now ex and I broke up yesterday and basically he's said he's not ready for something this serious so young (I'm a girl if that changes anything) and though neither of us wanted to break up, he's not fully invested and wants this in the future is the gist. I agree and know 100% its the right thing to do. I am now at all costs trying to avoid holding onto any hope of a future with him whatsoever. None! If its meant to happen it will, if its not it was never meant to be is my attitude - but I know myself, and I don't want even a tiny part of me to indulge this thought. Not easy of course, but I'm determined I will get there.   The best thing I have found to help me move on is imagining myself dating another person. Now that I'm single again I actually want to go out - surprises me as I'm not big into going out. I like going to bars, don't like clubbing and much prefer to be in bed at a decent time than out at 4am. I'm also not a huge drinker by any means - shouldn't surprise anyone I wouldn't think. More into my health and fitness. I'm going to try and relax about drinking a few drinks when I'm out. And actually wanting to go out is a huge helper. Not sure if any of the back story is relevant, I guess relevant to the extent that I'm not ready to go into a new relationship quite yet obviously, and being ""out of the scene"" for awhile I suppose.   Before we got together I was single for a long time. Finding myself single again, I'm pretty sure I'm going to be the same. Essentially, I'm not very good at meeting new people. I'm quite an introverted person and it takes awhile to get to know me, though I can be very friendly and easy to talk to when around the right people. Other people being easy going helps me be able to talk as I stop worrying about the conversation turning awkward.   So what happens when I meet someone new? My mind goes blank and I'm really nervous. Any questions they ask me I try keep the answers short. I feel like by describing what I'm doing with my life I could be construed as bragging, though its not like what I'm doing is much different to anyone else, and I'm so terrified the conversations going to go awkward that I either just babble or accidentally turn it into awkward by not having a huge response. Thing is too, actually getting to talk to someone new is a rarity in itself. I've been told I look quite reserved and once was told I look like i'm in a long term relationship - neither of these surprise me. I know I need to be more open to talking to people and experiencing other people, which I will of course try to do. So all in all, how do I go from meeting someone to potentially going on a date with them?!    **tl;dr**: Introverted/awkward around new people, how do I go from meeting someone to potentially going on a date with them?",r

I am nineteen, and in those short nineteen years of life, I have had many girlfriends, and made many mistakes. I would like to make something clear, though: It has always been my dream to one day have a beautiful family, complete with wife and three children of my own, living in a beautiful house with a stable job. This is why I have come to you for advice.  I can't seem to stay interested in relationships very long. I have fallen in and out with girls, but the story always comes up the same:  1. Really excited, met a cute girl, she's pretty cool, we share some interests.  2. Ask girl to movies, coffee, etc.  3. Get girls number, text a lot, have a lot of fun.  4. Two or three months later, ask girl to start dating.   5. Date for a solid two or three months, become dissatisfied with some aspect of the relationship (emotional, sexual, etc.).  6. Leave girl  This has been the case with my past four girlfriends. In high school, I dated a girl for two years, and I'm ashamed to say that on the second year, I cheated on her twice. I feel awful about it, and she never found out. We ended up breaking up for different reasons entirely. Before her, all girls followed the scheme above.   Some people may say ""oh, well, you just havent found the right girl yet!"" But I've been through so many... And I know two or three of them were so much like me, and we were so compatible, and I had genuine feelings for them. I still do, some of them. I miss the girl I dated for two years, and think about her quite a bit. I guess, in order, my questions would be as follows:  1. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Going from girl to girl, falling in and out in a few months?  2. Do i have a problem, not being able to hold on?   3. Is there anything I can do to prolong my interest in a girl?

1p9su3,1p9su3,,"I'll try to make this brief.  Husband's divorce decree was filed in 2009, this is what the separation agreement states: http://imgur.com/Ql4SjeR  He has ""Joint LEGAL custody"" with his ex, BUT has ""Primary Physical Custody"" according to the decree.  The child has lived with us full-time the past 4 years, biological ""mother"" (aka ex-wife) has had VERY limited contact....I think we counted she has had 10 days this year of visitation).  We were looking into having her sign something so we could claim him on taxes this year (since she still owes back support as well as owing $500+ of things that aren't covered by support order, but outlined in the decree), when I stumbled upon these:  http://imgur.com/JHdjBEF http://imgur.com/LfhhiiG  I've highlighted the areas most pertinent.  If I'm reading this correctly, basically, despite what the divorce decree says, we could have been claiming him for all the odd AND even years because my husband is defined as the custodial parent...and in order for the ex-wife to claim him (since the divorce decree was post 2008) my husband would have had to sign Form 8332 and she would have had to include that on her tax documents, am I reading this correctly?  If I am, my next question is: can we submit an addendum for our 2011 taxes claiming him as a dependent?  AND, should we do anything additional to be sure there's not any snafu with our taxes this year and claiming him (we've dealt with the IRS before, they're not really fun...and SLOW...unless you owe them money, then they'll take it right away!)

It seems that the advice that worked for me last time (""just talk to her"") isn't as compatible in this situation.  Maybe I'm over-thinking...or just need a confidence boost or something. In any case help is appreciated.",r
mx3oc,mx3oc,thudec,"I've been with my girlfriend for 8 months now. First relationship for me. For some reason it always feel like when we have sex, it's because she initiated it. When we go to bed and I'm in the mood, I kiss and caress her and just try to initiate. If I feel like she's not responsive I give up. The thing is that she is rarely responsive when I'm the one initiating. I'm stuck in the mindset that if she want to have sex, I will easily know. So when we don't have sex I'm not sure if it's because I missed her ""signal"" or I didn't try hard enough or that she's just not in the mood. And then I get frustrated with myself. Even when we flirt all day long, when the night come there is a big chance she won't make a move or I give up trying getting things started.  Maybe I give up to quickly? Maybe I could just ask her if she's in the mood? Any tips from more experienced people would be great. I'm kinda lost.",r
e1pkvgi,8vpryf,OhFuckNoDude,"You need to reset all her passwords to everything, using a device he has never touched.  It's likely he has installed something on her phone and computer to track her typing, so both should probably be factory reset. Instructions for this can be found online.  Remove both devices from the internet immediately. Change her wifi password as well.  Enable two factor authentication whereever possible, and check her email for any forwarding rules that may be sending her email on.  Get cameras if possible, keep an eye on her car.  As a side note, a carbon monoxide detector would be a good idea as well.  These are paranoid steps, but this is something that could turn pretty serious, assuming it's real.",l
c2hx1pr,k6ngd,,"A friend of mine was in a similar situation. He and his girlfriend had been together for over 3.5 years. I'll give you the same advice I gave him. You *have* to leave her. It's a violation of trust and disrespectful to you. There is no excuse for that behavior, even if she was drunk there is *always* a moment where you can stop and think, especially if it's something that big.  You'd be disrespecting yourself by staying with someone who went behind your back. If you did take her back, what's to stop her from doing it to you again if she sees that there is no consequence for the worst thing she could do to your relationship? That trust is shattered and can never be the same. Talk is cheap, and actions speak volumes. She can say that you were the only one for her and all that BS, but in the end what she SHOWED you was completely contradictory. It's a sad, sorry situation and you didn't ask for it. Now all that's left for you to do is move on and wish her the best.  It's not a question of forgiveness or hatred. That's a false choice. Not staying together doesn't mean you necessarily hate her. This decision is more about you than her. How much do you respect yourself?",r
cxsjc30,3w1a0x,defsnotalawyer,"1. This sounds like fraudulent misrepresentation which can occur in both torts and contract law. It really depends on your job and situation. If you're just filing paperwork, I don't see what they would try to recover. If you do cost the company money, though, and it's big, they may be able to pursue action against you. It may also limit certain remedies if you try to sue your employer later. 2. There are certain professions where there are statutes regulating who can be in them and who can say they are one. Physicians are definitely one of these. They are enumerated in Wis. Stat. 440.03. Violating the statutes could hold serious, serious consequences. Beyond those, it would probably fall under fraudulent misrepresentation or something similar.  Best case scenario is they fire your ass and it ends there. But you are exposing yourself to legal risk by lying to your employer. Seems like you already guessed that. Mileage may vary. If you do get caught, this could also severely affect your chances of future employment. You're probably better off talking to your employer and seeing if they will let you finish your degree or finding another job.",l

c20b94l,hwxho,ModernRonin,"Hopefully my comment didn't come off as judgmental. If it did, I didn't intend it that way.  For a lot of people, and in many situations, a casual short-term thing works, and is good while it lasts. The breakup usually sucks, natch, but that's a given - it's a breakup. The point is, sometimes a short-term relationship is perfectly reasonable. Especially if everyone involved is realistic, and nobody wants anything more. Vacations wouldn't be as much fun if they lasted forever, and sometimes short term relationships can work the same way.  Obviously you don't fool yourself about where it's gonna end up. But I had a relationship that I explicitly stated was: ""For as long as it lasts, and whatever good can come of it."" And it's still one of my favorite relationships. That probably had more to do with who I was in it with than the duration of the relationship... But still, it shows that a short-term relationship *can* be a good relationship, if you're mature and honest and smart enough to not fool yourself.

4v17mk,4v17mk,Snickford,"I'm in PA and my son attends a private college in PA. On 7/15/16 I paid the balance of his upcoming Fall 2016 semester based on the invoice I received from their online access. I kept a copy of the invoice and then also printed a copy stating a zero balance. On 7/28/16, I accessed the account and it shows a balance due of $300. The breakdown of charges shows an increase in both Tuition and Student Fees. After speaking with student accounts, they state that the original amounts shown were incorrect and we still owe the additional $300. I stated that I had the paperwork showing the tuition and fees with a zero balance, they asked me to send them to them. I realize that to not make my son's final year in this school a living hell and in order for him to graduate, I'm going to have the pay the additional charges. Do I have any legal grounds to negotiate a reduction or elimination of this additional amount since they are claiming that this must have been some sort of a software glitch. I suspect that their claim of a software glitch is dishonest at best as for the last 3 years, they've been adding random, inaccurate charges onto his account, which I've been forced to dispute at each occurrence.  Also, is it normal for colleges to increase tuition at will or are they under any obligation legally to hold to the amount they publish?  This is my last kid in his last year. I'm so over this....",l
eggg0,eggg0,PossiblyRegrettable,"So, to sum things up, I recently started dating a girl who I think is really cool. Things had been going great in the weeks prior to us dating, and so far are really still fine. However, I have a slight dilemma:  Her prior boyfriend passed away about eight months ago, while they were still dating. It's a pretty sad story from what I know, but we met in college so I never knew they guy. It's kinda clear early on that she was still really attached to this guy, so I had some semblance of what I was getting into.   Like I said before, nothing is really *wrong* right now, I just feel like things are going really slowly (as I would expect), and she's seemed particularly distant for the last week or so (We've only been dating a short time, but I met her last year, so we've been friends for a long time). I suppose the question I'm posing is this:   Is it something I should be at all concerned about? I have conflicting feelings that she might be hung up for a really long time, and that I just need to give it a couple of weeks. But, in light of the fact that things just seem to be getting more complicated, I'm not sure. I guess I'm in over my head already. Any advice?",r

c9lglvy,1cyidu,bluenaut,"Sorry, but I think I'm far from shallow. I'm simply being honest about something a lot of people keep to themselves.   Consider this, for example:  Would you date a guy who is in the morbidly obese category? Someone who is, let's say, five, six, or seven-hundred pounds? Let's say guy is intelligent, comes from a nice family that you like, and has a fantastic personality.  If you're like most people, you probably would not.   The extreme on the other end is a person who is incredibly fit and attractive. I'm sure you would give no thought to dating such a person provided that the personality isn't awful. I wouldn't.   So the question is this: *where* does one draw the line in-between these two extremes?  FIT --------------------------| -----------------------REPULSIVE  What exactly can you tolerate?  FIT [----------YES----------------][-------NO-------] REPULSIVE  I'm not shallow for not wanting to date a kind, friendly, seven-hundred pound woman. Do you find that attractive? Do you desire that? Of course you don't.   At the end of the day, we have to be physically attracted to the person we're dating, and I cannot bring myself to be intimate with someone who I find unattractive and unhealthy. It's just gross.   The problem here is that I like everything else about this girl. But she's past the point that I'm willing to tolerate with regard to her physique. This is a problem only because I know that she can resolve this issue by adjusting her lifestyle. She used to be very fit, very physically attractive, and has only let herself get this way due to some recent stress (i.e. comfort food).   Can I address this issue? Is that my place to be honest about? Or do I just make up a bullshit excuse as to why we're not going to take our relationship past the friendship level?   And it even goes deeper than that. A person who has turned to comfort food and allowed herself to put on an unreasonable (in my opinion) amount of weight clearly does not value something that is important to me--and if that's the case, then perhaps we shouldn't get involved. Perhaps it's a sign of underlying issues that I don't want to have to put up with. It could also be a sign that she'll be incapable of participating in many of the activities that I find interesting. This may be an indicator of multiple, incompatible scenarios.   But I know that she doesn't like being her current weight, I know there's a girl that I find goddamn attractive inside there, and I know that in a very short amount of time she can fix this issue. The question is whether I can be honest about my feelings or not.   TL;DR - Not wanting to be with someone until she looses weight is *not* about being shallow. Everyone draws the line somewhere because physical appearance and lifestyle choices do matter",r

I was turning when I made contact, so the back corner of my bumper directly impacted the front passenger door. There was a dent in the door panel, but no other visible damage. I immediately rang my neighbor's doorbell and explained what happened. The car belongs to their new nanny, which is why I'd never seen it there before. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; I told her I'd pay for the repairs, gave her my insurance info, and took some pictures. I never contacted my insurance because I figured it would cost about $1-2k to fix, which I'd rather pay than have my premium go up. Our rates are already high because my wife has had 2 collisions in the past 5 years. I've been told I should have contacted my insurance anyway. Lesson learned. I've never been in an accident, and I was going to be late for work, so I wasn't thinking too clearly. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Anyway, we got the repair estimate yesterday, and it's a whopping $4400. For a 2008 Lincoln Navigator. I cannot believe that it costs that much to repair a car door for a 10-year old car. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Can I ask that they check with another repair shop? They took it to the dealership collision center. Can I contact my insurance company even though it was 3 months ago? What are my options? I feel like I'm being ripped off here. Or is just going to be a very expensive life lesson? We can afford it, but it's going to wipe out our emergency fund.

hjalr,hjalr,,"Hi Reddit, long time lurker, first time anonymous posting coward. I'm a late 20s male, in a year long relationship with a late 20s female. Long story short, I love her, but certain aspects of our relationship are really bothering me.   First the good.. She's a good match to me. We have a pretty good time together, enjoy lots of the same things, have a relatively healthy sex life together, and generally get along really well. She loves me deeply, and genuinely cares more for me than anyone else has ever seemed to. We're best friends, definitely, and she's also very beautiful, which sugar coats some of   The bad...  She doesn't really ever act on that love. She's rarely affectionate, and when she is it's pretty clear that it's just because  I've complained about it and she's afraid to lose me. Otherwise, she just doesn't do much to be an equal participant in the relationship. While I've done a TON of traveling, cooking, grocery shopping, dishes, apartment hunting, moving her shit, her taxes, etc, she's... made me dinner four or five times. I've asked her to do more, like wash the sheets more regularly because I'm allergic to her cat, and she said she would weekly but it's been more like tri-annually. I admit I don't nag her, because I want her to just voluntarily do these things to maintain a healthy balance in our relationship. It's not really working. Her go-to excuse is that since I don't ask her to do things, and I do them instead, I must WANT to do them.. Right now, I'm working a LOT and writing this post is the most free personal time I've had in months. I'm noticeably VERY stressed and tired, and I guess I just expected her to step up.   To make matters more tense, she is constantly reminding me that she wants me to propose to her. This started at around 6 months, peaked at around a year when she started crying from her dissapointment that I didn't propose on our one year anniversary, and has subsided only some. She looks for opportunities to hint at it and finds one almost every day. I'm nowhere near ready to marry her, while it seems like it was her primary objective from the very beginning.  And the ugly..  The laziness extends to other areas of our life. While I'm hesitant to complain because I'm getting sex several times a week, she's one of those girls who just lays there.. quietly.. She says she's always been like that in bed, and was the first time we had sex too so I guess I believe it... In her younger, wilder, more manic days I know she had sex with a LOT of guys, so combine that with the quiet passivity, and I guess I feel a bit inadequate. I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother the hell out of me.   And then there's the drug use.. In her past, she'd regularly smoked crack, snorted heroin, and god knows what else with her loser 20 years older ex-boyfriend. That bothers the hell out of me too. I'll smoke a couple of bowls of green and share it with her, that doesn't bother me, but she'll go through a bottle of pain killers in a matter of two weeks if I don't hide them from her. She's just got an addictive personality and I'm afraid she'll make friends with the wrong person some day, start that shit up again, and hide it from me.  I'm terrified to leave her, or even have a substantial fight with her, mostly because she's been diagnosed as bipolar II. The first time I saw her under a lot of stress, just new job / moving stress, she seemed fine while I left to take a load to her storage, when I got back I learned she burned her leg purposefully with a lighter as a ""reminder."" She's got a lot of similar scars, so it's pretty clear this is a pattern with her. I know I mean a lot to her and leaving her would really fuck her over emotionally, so I feel a lot of guilt. I'm afraid she'd hurt herself primarily, or ruin her job. Meanwhile, we're looking for a new apartment together and it's getting to be a stickier and stickier situation.  What can I do? I do love her, so dumping her doesn't seem logical, and yet it seems like the problems in our relationship are going to be really hard to fix. Is it selfish to feel like she's just too much work?

dejfo1s,5x8cya,lvlthrowawayhelpnded,"I was terminated first thing on Friday morning when I showed up to the new job that I started on Monday, so I never got the chance to ask.  I now have a followup question.  Timeline Recap:  I signed the contract with Company A two years ago.  The employment started to go sideways about half way through the first year.  It kept sliding downhill for the remaining 18 months until I had no choice but to get another job.  (Maybe the details of the employment with Company A will be relevant at a later time...)  I received the sue threat letter from Company A's attorney via email at about 5pm on Thursday.  I was terminated from the new job Friday morning.  So the clause in the contract says, ""...if Company A commences an action to enforce..."" that I'll have to pay the legal fees, court costs, etc.  My followup question is two parts:  Can I commence an action to enforce the contract, and if so, do I have to pay the company's legal fees and court costs if I am the one who commences an action?      The grounds that I want to use to ""commence an action"" is that I made an offer to repay the amount, and I received no response to my formal offer (the meeting was witnessed, minutes were recorded and a formal offer letter was proffered.)  Since it looks like *something* is going to be litigated here, and I strongly believe that the owner of Company A's exclusive motivation is to use the court to inflict punishment, I want to be the one who initiates the action.  At worst, the money is owing and payable and here is a judgement so report it on credit, collect, whatever, but I don't have to pay the Company's legal costs and court fees.  At best, the offer I proffered was reasonable and the Company should have responded on-point first, before threatening to sue with no mention whatsoever that we even entered into a good-faith negotiation to settle an undisputed debt.  Does my thought process have any basis in legal principles or the way courts view things?  We should note that before the contract was signed, the owner said that this is the contract he offers the people in my position, and that its take-it-or-leave-it.  He said I could show it to my attorney or whoever else I wanted to before I sign it, but we can't change anything.  I said, ""oh, ok, its a contract of adhesion.  I'll read it tonight and let you know tomorrow morning.""  My understanding is that if something in a contract of adhesion is vague or ambiguous, it must be interpreted in favor of the party it is being offered to (me.)  I also understand that these types of contracts are usually end-user agreements, insurance contracts and other things that are offered to a very large group of people.  This is a small company, and it doesn't offer hundreds of the same employment contract.  However, it has offered about 5 such contracts over the past 15 or so years, and all of them have terminated prior to the end because the employee could no longer benefit under its terms, and all had to pay the boss.  Was I right in considering this a ""contract of adhesion?""  Thanks again for taking the time to read my long-winded posts.  This whole situation is very stressful, and I will be finding a lawyer.  Its incredibly helpful to me to get some guidance on what to talk about with an attorney.  Thanks.",l

She was held in a room for 3 plus hours and coerced to write a confession. We, her parents, were not called until after the confession.   First question: is it legal for the school to coerce like this without calling parents?  What actually happened is this.  My daughter is a straight A student with mild aspbergers. She struggles to belong. She has been aware of the other kids popping pills.  She may have been involved with them months ago but over the last two months she realized it was a bad scene and has not been spending any time with any of them.   Last week, she had oral surgery where she was put under. Two anesthetics were involved plus she is on Lexapro and Hydrocodone for the pain. On Monday, she was not in her right mind and decided to sell some if the Hydrocodone.   The next day, somebody told on one of the other girls and several were found with a pharmacy of pills in their bags.  Many of them implicated my daughter. We believe she made a stupid mistake while on pain medication but is not the center of this pill problem.    We talked to the oral surgeon who says the medical chart did not show Lexapro.  He says he never would have used those two anesthetics if he had known about the Lexapro. The drug combination is known to cause altered personality in some cases.  We plan to speak at length about the drug interactions at the expulsion hearing.   Should we sue the dentist?

Specifically, if the logo itself is trademarked, registered, copyrighted, whatever. I have tried searching the SoundCloud website, various blog posts, articles, policies, etc. but have not been able to find anything as to the usage rights for the SoundCloud logo. The closest thing i could find was related to API usage, from the article at:  &gt;  &gt; https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use#branding &gt;  &gt; If i am understanding this page correctly, the logo may only be used under certain circumstances (for example, buttons), and any other usage is not allowed. However, this page seems to be in regards to, specifically, people who are developing apps that use the soundcloud API. This seems rather specific, and honestly just confused me a bit more. I'm hoping someone here may be able to clarify what exactly this means. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; I ask because as I was preparing to file my tax return, I logged onto a retailer's customer portal so that i could see my invoices from 2017. While browsing the site, i noticed that they used the soundcloud ""cloud"" logo on one particular interface/menu (except they changed the background from orange to grey). I should also mention that this company has absolutely nothing to do with soundcloud, as they are an agriculture-focused retailer. Basically, I'm just curious if they are legally allowed to use the cloud logo.      --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",l

Yeah, at this point it was already over.   &gt;I told her, that iam beginning to have feelings for her and what she was thinking. She then told me, that she tried it, but she still loves a guy, who broke her heart a short while before we met  You have to pay more attention to what the girl is saying nonverbally. She invited you in, with nonverbal cues (spending the night) , let you know she was attracted to you (little hearts at end of messages, many other things, second chances) and you did nothing. Then when you finally got around to making a (really bad) move, she's moved on. This comment above is her making an excuse for not being attracted to you anymore.   &gt;Also I dont think, that she just played with me,   No, she didn't. She liked you, you blew it, and she friendzoned you.   &gt;but I dont want to get full friendzoned here.   You probably were the first night you didn't make a move.  I'm amazed you got a second a third and fourth chance with this one.  She must have really liked you at first. That may be a possible saving grace, but you're really not ready for this if you missed that many opportunities. You've got your wires crossed a little and need some practice.   &gt;So I dont think that they will get together anytime soon, they are not even in contact.  He's just an excuse cause it's very hard to tell someone the truth about these things sometimes.   Look, I know this is a little harsh, but it's a good learning experience.  One of the things that makes a man attractive is if he can REALLY LISTEN to a woman. Not just the words coming out of her mouth, but her gestures, actions, tone, and hints.   You weren't listening.   I'm going to give you an example:   If a girl  you've known forever (your whole life) crashes at your house after a movie, it doesn't mean anything. There's no motive to that action.   If a girl you don't know very well at all stays over at your place after a date, that's a HUGE hint. Why?   You're unfamiliar! You could be a rapist, or worse, but she's choosing to trust you. Why should she do that? It doesn't make logical sense in the strictest way.......so what it means is she's setting herself up so that you can display your attraction to her. She's been flirting with you, now it's you're turn. But while you were herp derping and falling asleep, she's lying there thinking something like this:  ""Why isn't he trying to kiss me? Is he messing around with me? Am I not attractive to him? Or is he that stupid that he doesn't realize I like him? Or maybe he's a dick like that one asshole I dated, who always ignored me. I shouldn't be here right now, this was a bad idea.....""",r

It'd be different if you met this girl outside of Uni... like at some volunteering event (commonality = you both value volunteering)... or at some social gathering (commonality = you both like X/Y/Z Music or X/Y/Z style of art)  Just because this girl is ""perfect"".. doesn't mean she's ""perfect for you""....

oph1b,oph1b,TheBigPotato,"I stumbled onto this forum searching the internet for possible answers to an emotional problem I am experiencing and, though I didn't find anything directly relevant, I was convinced that this might be an fruitful place to pose this question.  My situation is this: I have been in a remarkably balanced and honest relationship with a loving, intelligent and beautiful woman for some time (close to six months). Despite how intellectually and personally close we are, I am only able to experience feelings of sexually intoxication for her if I smoke weed, or else randomly, during fleeting and uncontrollable intervals. That's not to say that I don't ""Love"" her, whatever that means. I most certainly do.  As someone who has become sexually infatuated with random, distant women in the past, this situation is little frustrating. The emotional part of my brain, apparently, is not my friend.  I would never leave her over it, of course. She is my best friend, after all, and the connection and company we share is worth more than any physical high. It is frustrating (for both of us, we have talked about this) to know that, while I have felt overwhelming and persistent lust for women that mean nothing to me, I've rarely felt that way about her, and not so intensely.  It's also frightening to think that I could sexually latch on to another woman despite our being together, though I suspect I am more capable of suppressing budding, naive infatuation at my age than I was in the past.  Furthermore, I am worried that I might fall back into lust for one of my old infatuations (who I never considered a friend, even) that I occasionally see around. This is the last thing I want to happen, but I know well enough how infatuation develops to be concerned about this having this anxiety - it may very well happen because I am worried about it, or because I am concerned it might happen because I am worried about it. Point being, this sort of rumination isn't healthy. Old emotions are easier to dig out than new ones. Fuck my brain. Fuck. (Obviously I wouldn't be here if not for this paragraph.)  The power random (and physically intimidating) women have had over me is terrifying, it seems to be tap in to more than just my sexuality. Shame, fear and humiliation are, unfortunately, other powerful emotions that are tied into my sexuality. It's incredibly frustrating and embarrassing, though not inexplicable given aspects of my upbringing, which was never physically abusive but which had elements of sexual and emotional repression and confusion.  I wanted to know if any readers of this forum had any experiences they could relate, or advice they could give.  Thank you.",r

1m8dtt,1m8dtt,whiskey_n_weed,"So I've been with my current girlfriend for about 2 years now. It started as just hooking up, but as time went on I started to really like her. She had (has) stronger feelings than I did sooner than I did. I do love the girl. She's sweet, and totally loves me. Probably one of the sweetest girls I've ever been with.   We have our problems. We seem to argue a lot. There's a 5 year age difference between us, her being younger than I. She has, personality quirks, that sometimes annoy the piss out of me. She also gets extremely emotional, and is on prozac (I think). Not that it makes her a bad person, it just gets to be too much to deal with. We also live about an hour apart and,  with both of us working through the week, only get to see each other weekends. When we do see each other its either really fun, or we spend most of the time arguing. She's the youngest child of a big family, and due to that and previous relationships she's used ti whining and getting what she wants.  But then I think about how good it is when we aren't arguing. We have fun with each other. The sex is INCREDIBLE! I'm a pretty big dude,  but I have a good face and carry my self well. But I'm no channing tatum and as such I don't have chicks throwing themselves at me. She's got a pretty face, good body, awesome ass. I wish her boobs were bigger, but that's not all its about. I'd say looks wise she's at the upper end of what I'm able to pull.   But we don't connect as well as I did with my ex. I feel like my heart isn't totally in it. I'm not sure if its a sign I should break it off and look for someone I'm more compatible with mentally and emotionally, or if I should stick with it and hope that her immaturity goes away as she gets older.",r

My last ex cheated on my with my now ex best friend. It was the worst breakup ever a double whammy. I have no friends in the first place so I had to keep it in. So now I have trust issues. Not as bad but still up there.   So I explained to my boyfriend more and more why. Well because I'm getting promoted I don't have to work till the new location opens so I been out of a job just for this month so no money till we open. I live with him so I'm always home. I ask if he needs space he says no And if his friends invite him he asks me to go. I always say no you go play with your friends and have fun. He says come on it's ok I don't mind I love hanging out with you. Well ok :)    So I don't think much of it. Last night he pretty much said he needed his space and why I don't go out.

If i had to guess, I would attribute her detachment to the fact that though she may not want to admit it, she knows she's going to lose you. Conversations about college probably only intensify that fear. However, sex alleviates it temporarily.

And it sounds like you're going to have plenty of places to look. Being afraid to commit at this point in your life does not make you a horrible guy. And trust me, you really don't want to go into college attached, particularly not to someone you just kinda like.  Young romances are fun, but fleeting. It's natural.

1t5m9d,1t5m9d,,"Hello Reddit. This would be my first legit post, so please be gentle. Also, side note, terribly sorry for the huge text. Unfortunately to understand my position it takes quite a bit of back story and I’m sorry for that.   	So, the story starts in freshman year of college, I had met a pretty chill chick and I had a pretty big crush on her. I pushed too hard and she pulled back. Shit ton of drama happens and I am a wimp who won’t confess. Within all the time of the drama, there was a plan. I had a wing man. It was a good friend of mine. The plan was for my wing man to get to know the crush and report back and help me get closer to her, the “sling-shot effect”. My plan was to get close to the best friend at the time to then get closer to the crush, another “sling-shot” effect. It takes me until the summer of freshman year to confess to her and I get turned down pretty hard. I try not to cry, cry anyways.   	It takes me the entire rest of the summer to semi get over this girl. I fell for her, and I fell hard. I met a few other girls here and there during the summer, but each of them were just replacements for her. They all had some sort of attribute that is similar to her. I only realize now that during that time of me trying to cope, I never got over her. I did talk to some of my closer friends about this and it did not go anywhere. Sure they told me to just get over her and move on, but I have tried constantly and it has not worked.   	Now fast forward to current day. Things are “normal” between me and the crush and we still joke around. My feeling are still the same as ever, even after being turned down. The best friend and the crush are no longer that close. My wing man has gotten very close to the crush, and has stopped reporting back to me. I presume it is to help me get over the crush but it still doesn't feel right.    	So now after all this back story, on to the problem. My crush has gotten into a relationship over the course of the college year. Things ended badly with that relationship, and I tried to comfort her but, she did not want to talk to me. This happened back during the winter break of 2012. Now it is winter break of 2013, and she has fallen for yet another person. (Not me if you haven’t figured out)  	So, I know that my chances are slim to none, but I must ask. Is there even a chance. If there is, how should I approach it?  If there is not, how should I deal with this, or rather, what should I do? I understand that if I actually like this girl, I should prioritize her happiness, and I have for a long time, but it hurt me very deeply when she was hurt before. Now I’m scared as to how I would feel if/when my crush gets together with another person. It hurts me to see myself like this. I understand that I should move on, but for some reason I cannot. Again I apologize for the length but this has been cut down a lot.   	Thank you Reddit for any and all help that you can give me.",r

However, I'm at the point in my life where I'm playing for keeps and I want to get married and start a family.  I've brought it up with him and he says he sees this in his future, that he loves me, and that this will happen, but I have this nagging feeling that he's stringing me along.    He's not a bad guy, and I don't think he's lying per say.  I think he's hoping that he will feel this way.  I've made it known that I'm not looking for a long term boyfriend, and will end the relationship if this is the type of relationship he wants.  I'm thinking maybe he's not being entirely honest with me or himself for that matter.    My ambivalence has to do with his actions.   I figure someone who is marriage minded would be saving money.  He has some pretty expensive hobbies and spends most of his money on watches, bikes and cameras. I know he doesn't have any money saved.  I also think that maybe I'm not really that special to him.  I'm in nursing school right now, and kind of scraping by.  When we go out for dinner we go dutch or sometimes I pay the whole bill.  He has a good job.

(if anyone who has or has failed to reconcile a situation like the one i'm describing could chime in, that would be cool).",r

The question would be though is can an employer compel the employee to purchase their product and does it count as an uniform.   I'm pretty sure you can't tell an employee that you HAVE to buy their product. They can incentivize it, but not compel it. The uniform issue is what is at stake. In BC employees can take a returnable deposit, reimburse, take away from pay, or have to pay for a uniform. Otherwise they can't say ""you have to wear this and pay for it"".

Also, get a job. A judge is less apt to send you to jail if being in jail will actually be detrimental to your life in a real way.   I've spent some time in court rooms for various things, and you see a lot of other cases while you're there. Pretty much any time I've ever seen anyone make no attempt to pay a fine or find a job to pay said fine, they end up in jail. But usually, if a person shows that they take the matter seriously and are truly trying, the judge will grant them exentions to a certain extent.

e5bzpmy,9cmze2,Author_33,"I haven't seen any MSDS sheets. The ""regularly used"" cleaning supplies kept on our carts are pretty standard disinfectants, glass cleaner, and bleach (I wish they had rules for bleach, but oh well) I don't really think these cleaners would require MSDA sheets... however, in a closet that we all have a key to, there are much harsher chemicals, although they have warning labels on the bottles I don't think people read them... I've seen people use these without much regard as to how they should use them or what their true purpose is. The guide to what chemicals are used for what jobs is in English only, even though more than half our staff only speaks Spanish...  I see now the only required manuals are for hazards/toxic things. I wish it was required for standard procedures too, my main concerns as far as not having a procedures manual is that everyone cleans according to how they feel it should be done... and the extra stuff that no one feels like doing never gets done (like cleaning the supplies). I'm not sure if any of this is a violation of OSHA but I am curious...? They take mops from bathrooms to breakrooms without washing them in between, they don't wash mop buckets when they're done and they always have dirt build up in them, I've cleaned them out before but a week later it is back, and mop closets look horribly dirty. They use rags with one type of chemical then later spray it with another type to clean something else without any regard as to what was previously on the rag... as far as biohazards go, I thought feces needed to be cleaned with a strong antimicrobial antibacterial germicide, but I see on the OSHA site they instruct to use bleach, I also read bleach is easily inactivated by organic material ...so now I don't really know how bleach works. but I know they do not measure when using bleach.  I am not in too much fear of my staff getting hurt as much as I am worried about their methods of cleaning affecting the people we are cleaning for. For instance, there are at least 5-10 pregnant women who work in the office at any given time (2,000 people total) and my staff is required to clean the nursery/lactation areas where these mothers pump and store their milk. this is where cross-contamination concerns me the most. my second biggest concern is the bathroom/break room cross-contamination.

dkexl1q,6o3u44,iridisss,"IANAL.                 Physical protection, home security/alarms, scrubbing all information about you on the internet (e.g. not post about going out to dinner), and escalating this with the police/government are the main recommendations I have for you.                 Get some physical protection around you, like pepper spray, a taser, or even a gun if you feel that threatened. Anything that you can carry around, and at-home protection. I might add, if he sees you actually obtain a handgun, he might back down simply from seeing you get serious. Money is money, but no hitman would die for it.                 Home security is big here. A good alarm system, with security cameras and motion sensors, will help your safety immensely. Some solar lights for your yard at night might reduce chances of a home attack. Reducing your chances of him actually physically doing anything against you is key, even if it is a bluff. Be it at home, at work, or being out and about. It might be a bit overkill, but also stay in bright and public areas when you step outside.              The third part is the most important, because this is your main chance at actually stopping this entire situation. As such, listen to others' advice as well. Do absolutely everything you can in regards to the government and the law. Like someone else said, contact their parole officer. In my opinion, this takes precedence over much else, because it's the greatest chance of succeeding, and probably the easiest to do. And increase your presence. Go to the DA, find some cop friends/contacts, and get involved with the police as much as possible. Someone else suggested reporting the boss's meth problem. Another person siggested the IRS. Basically, entangle yourself with law enforcement. All other solutions are temporary, or only minor safeguards, while this is where you attack back, under the protection of the law.                   Put your foot down, don't give in, and go on the offensive^^1. Remember, no one can win a battle on only defense. Best of luck to you, and I hope to see an update post, because you'll still be here to post it.                    -----------                 ^^1 Safely.

So you have to be really honest with yourself about what you're capable of doing. No matter how hard you try to tell yourself that you're not attached, if you are then you are.   Why would you be embarrassed to say that you've only been with girls that you've been in a relationship with?! That's ridiculous.   I guess if you really want to get some experience outside of relationships my advice would be to start with something really meaningless. It sounds harsh, but find someone who's looking for just like a one night stand. Don't try to stay in touch, and my personal most important factor is don't cuddle.",r

Generally we were a pretty open relationship. I've always told her exactly how I think and feel, and she has always accepted me (probably why it was so easy for me to tell her immediately afterwards).

nhaui,nhaui,,"My wife and I have been married for 13 years, and we're in our mid/late thirties.  We've always been pretty open with each other with everything except sex.  While we do talk about the things we like during sex, we never really talk about fantasies.  Out of the blue, she asked me if I had any fantasies.  I told her about mine (I'd like to have sex in odd places, such as the woods, the beach, the car, etc.)  I asked her the same.  She looks me dead in the eye and says   ""I'd like to be raped.""  The type of relationship we've had is often a joking one.  One of the pranks we like to pull on each other is saying something really absurd, then putting on a crazy-stare.  Well, she didn't crazy stare, and I actually had to ask her a few times if she was being serious.  I asked her the obvious questions as follows:  * Are you insane? * Were you ever beaten as a child? * What does lead paint taste like? * Do you actually expect me to organize a rape for you?  Turns out she just wants *me* to do it, which does make the fantasy a bit more sane(though not by much.)  I've never really be aggressive in sex, and it's not exactly one of those things you can easily approach without either A)Commiting a major felony, and/or B)Ruining whatever thrill there is in rape fantasies.  Asking ""Would you enjoy being raped right now?"" ruins the immersion of the fantasy.  Doing it without her genuine consent is obviously right out.  How can I indulge her fantasy without the crazy complicated parts being a problem?  Has anyone managed to work out a solution with their spouse?  Also, any advice for building endurance would be great.  Not sexual endurance, I can handle that.  But plain physical endurance.  She's a bit more fit than I am, so it's hard to fight her down AND have sex with her without completely winding myself and being sore an hour later.

Non-competes are generally not valid in CA.  However, you need to be careful when you are susceptible to the personal jurisdiction of another state because you could end up with the other state's courts enforcing the non-compete against you.  A while ago, the CA Sup Ct allowed a company to get a MN court to enforce a non-compete injunction that was being litigated in both states, regardless whether it was enforceable in CA.  In that case, the MN courts had personal jurisdiction over the EE.   In the worst situation, you end up with lawsuits in both CA and IL.",l

cy1zr1z,3x6jva,lawnerdcanada,"IANAL.  A search warrant describes the place that may be searched and the things that may be seized. The police can't get a warrant to search, for instance, for ""any evidence of any crime"". Their application for the warrant must specify the evidence they expect to find and wish to seize.   Obviously, this dictates what they may search. If the evidence they're searching for is a handgun, they can't search a tiny jewellery box. If they're searching for a stolen laptop, they can't search a shoebox or a small safe. If the evidence they're searching for might be contained inside a locked container, though, they can certainly open it (provided that's within the scope of the warrant).   As the Ontario Court of Appeal held in *[R v Church of Scientology (No. 6)](http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1987/1987canlii122/1987canlii122.html)*:    &gt;On the vexed and difficult question as to whether the things to be searched for and seized were described with sufficient particularity, I was referred to a very large number of cases, some upholding and some refusing to uphold a warrant. Many of these cases are instructive in that they outline and develop the principles upon which these matters are to be judged. These principles appear to me to include the following. **The description of what is to be searched for must not be so broad and vague as to give the searching officers carte blanche to rummage through the premises of the target.** The things must be described in such a way as to guide the officer or officers carrying out the search and assist them in identifying the object. Classes of things, including documents, may be authorized to be seized, but such classes should normally be limited both with respect to time and with respect to their relationship to the crime or crimes with respect to which they are said to afford evidence. Each information and subsequent warrant should be viewed as a whole and should not stand or fall as a result of a minute or microscopic analysis of each of the parts. Each case must stand upon its own facts.   (emphasis added)",l

If not, don't be discouraged.  Just take it in stride and keep going!  There are many girls out there waiting to be swooned!  Not just by anyone!  BY YOU! Go get 'em!  You're the man (Or girl)!  You got this!  All the pep talk aside...  Just tell her.  Be straight forward.  There is no magical phrase that will makes this ""easy"".  A few things that I note from your post:  Don't mention anything about sex.  That'll work itself out.  This is just me assuming, but it sounds like you're throwing that out as a safeguard.  Don't be worried about it.  If it's something that you both want, it'll happen.  The ""I'm lonely"" line really worries me.  It sounds like you may have some self-image issues that need to be worked out.  This isn't a bad thing, we all have our issues!  The key is to love yourself.  If you're not the person you want to be, start becoming that person.  Make small goals for yourself, and work towards them.  Don't beat yourself up over the small things you do wrong.  Instead, work on rewarding yourself for everything you do right!  You CAN do anything you set your mind to!  The process will be slow at first, but you'll find yourself being more and more content with life in general once you start doing those things you always wished you could do!  It all has to start somewhere! :)  Being positive not only helps with mental fatigue (less stress) and energy (again, less stress), but it's also VERY attractive!  It's always good to be in control of yourself before entering into a relationship.  A phrase that really helped me in my downtime was ""Don't think of it as searching for your 'other half', you must be whole, yourself, before you can look for another.""

531n6b,531n6b,TossedHither,"I was moving house yesterday. Had a rental moving van. It was parked with the back end towards the road with the back doors open but no part of the vehicle was outside of the parking space lines. I was inside the van, moving some boxes towards the doors so I could take them out easier. At that moment a car (a fancy one, an old Cadillac of some kind. I don't know much about cars though) hit one of the doors. The Cadillac has scratched paint and a broken side mirror, the van's door is dented because of which it can't be closed anymore.   I obviously contacted the rental company and filled out an accident report with the driver's details (and my details). The rental company told me I need to pay a fee for damaging the van, even though it wasn't my fault. The Cadillac driver took responsibility and admitted that I was fully within the parking space when he hit the van. Is the rental company right here; do I have to pay this fee, or is Cadillac man the one they need to ask?  Edit; forgot to add that all other costs (repairs etc.) will be a matter for insurance.

In Illinois, even the final melee of *Enter the Dragon* wouldn't be an aggravating factor.   The Ninth Circuit ruled that bare hands aren't a deadly weapon for Federal criminal purposes, which does nothing to diminish my appreciation of *Con Air*.  In Utah, you can be charged with aggravated assault if you used ""a dangerous weapon ... or other means or force likely to produce death or serious bodily injury"".

wya5o,wya5o,,"First time post. Forgive me.   My SO [20/m] and I [18/f] started dating only after hitting rock bottom with my previous boyfriend of 4 years ( tumultuous to say the least) Don't get me wrong, I didn't rush into anything. Previous boyfriend and I had been broken up for some time, however we still maintained this kind of ""halfway"" relationship. (We enjoyed spending time with each other but ultimately were negative influences in each others lives) We saw each other on a daily basis because of obligations to school extracurriculars and engaged regularly. This put a major hold on the progression of my relationship with my current boyfriend. When things finally resolved with former boyfriend, my relationship with my current boyfriend finally took off (now have been dating for close to 7 months) I realized that not only was he 10x the person my former boyfriend was, but also that much more suitable for me. We've spent the majority of the summer together and I consider myself to be in a happier, healthier place than I  ever have been. This fall I will begin my first year of college and although my bf and I attend different schools we have decided to stay together. He's extremely intelligent, handsome, funny, supportive, great in bed, everything I could want in a partner.. But I'm not sure everything is right. As cliche as it sounds, I don't feel like i am as passionate about him as I should be. With my ex, I think I felt more deeply than I should have. I care  about my boyfriend deeply and I certainly don't miss my ex..   Which leaves me wondering, if I don't like him as much as I think I do or if I've lost touch with a part of myself.. Almost like on a subconscious level I won't allow myself to feel anymore connected to my current bf. I would like to make it clear that I do have a serious  emotional attachment and physical attraction to him which is why this situation has been so troubling. The more serious we get and the faster school approaches the more I find myself wondering about this.   Has anyone experienced similar feelings?  Reddit, I need your help.   TL;DR felt more for douchebag ex than I do for wonderful current bf, possible emotional blockage.",r

pu3sl,pu3sl,yawa_worht_ym,"There's a girl (26/F) I think I (28/M) love who I will never be with again.  We spent some time together over 5 years ago before I moved away from home. The experiences were unique and exhilirating. There were several years in that time where I thought 'she's the one'. We've never had sex or really .. more than just making out. She's several states away living her life.  I was not the same person I am now. I am more confident. I have more going on with my life.   Whenever I think about her I get that butterfly feeling.  We haven't 'chatted' in a while but when we did last year I sort of remember bringing up being in love with her.   I'm in a relationship now (with 27/F). We've been together since April of 2011 and I already broke up with her once in November for 2 months and we're back together now.  I care about her .. I value her in my life but I struggle with the concept of 'love' with her. I have told her I loved her once .. and I felt very apprehensive doing it. I feel a connection with her and I have envisioned what life would be like in 10 years with kids and a house. I don't feel comfortable about it. It's not what I want. I don't have faith she will have the drive to constantly improve her lifestyle like I do. I also fear that I am holding someone else to too-high of a standard. The other girl (26/F) has that drive .. she is her own person. An artist .. with life. (Cheesy, right.)  I am happy with the relationship now as far as companionship. She is definitely my best friend. I have felt pangs of sadness when I think about breaking up with her again .. so I am not certain it would be easy for me to let her go (again). I am almost afraid to make her hurt. I like making her happy but I'm afraid of not letting her have something that makes her happy (me).   I don't know what to do. I don't think I could handle a breakup right now .. I think it would devastate her .. she was depressed through the time we were broken up. She gained some weight. Things were rough, moreso for her than me.  UGH. Why did I ever think getting into a relationship was a good idea!@#!

I went on the 28th to pick up the keys, pay pro rated rent for july, and pet deposit for Apartment2.  Property manager says nothing about pro rated rent for Apartment1 for July.  It's July 31st and Apartment1 hasn't been rented so we call the leasing agency to pay August rent for Apartment1, how much is rent and where to put it, so it's covered.  Just today we received a call stating that we didn't pay the pro rated rent for July for Apartment1.  I didn't even think about it since we didn't move into Apartment1 and the property manger didn't ask about it when I picked up keys for Apartment2.  We were told that we owe the pro rated rent for July for Apartment1 and a late fee.  Again I would assume so but it just kinda sucks since I completely forgot about it.

This bar was branded a ""restaurant"" but they had a DJ and a dance club set up that would run until 2 in the morning Thursday-Saturday. So, I understand where you are coming from on the music and sleep -- there were times when they would start at 11:00 and I would already be asleep and it would wake me up.  Anyway, what I did was call 911 every time and keep a log of times (no non-emergency number in my area - all calls go to 911). Then I read the local codes and called code compliance for their outdoor speakers and their parking (valet would drive down the residential alley for parking and that was not allowed). After talking with several code compliance guys, they came out and found a number of compliance issues and forced them to tear out their front deck and install fencing for the parking and some other things - all with accompanying fines. Meanwhile I also contact my city council member and got him involved and he worked to get a patrol officer to the area and he would come out each night and write noise tickets. Eventually the business shut down - not because of me, but more because of the fact that the owners were idiots (which is also why code hated them and the city council was willing to go to bat).  So, keep on with what you are doing and maybe look into other issues they have with code or alcohol license or parking and escalate to city council. If you have neighbors, get them on board too (we had 5 neighbors that would call 911 every night there was noise) - that gets the police to know it is not a single crazy person. You can also invite the responding officer up to your apartment so he/she can hear the noise.  It's a sucky situation and I wish you all the best in getting yours resolved.",l

About three weeks ago I discovered that my (now) long distance ex had an affair with a 'real life' friend of his a couple months back — It was a one time occurrence as far as I know. He tells me he didn't want it, and that in his mind he believed it to be 'unintentional cheating' or 'molestation.' He has given me until Friday to decide whether or not to go back to him.   I don't want to go back to him, but find it hard when my options are limited between the fear of being alone (I'm quite shy and anxious and terrible at forming relationships) or being unhappy in an unhealthy relationship.

1wsfpg,1wsfpg,kamfr,"I feel like an asshole. I've (m33) been with my partner (f33) for 4 years and we've been through a lot. Lots of shit and lots of beautiful, happy times. We recently married and we're truly happy together, we have trust, we work out our problems and we compromise as any good team should. One problem though has been hanging in the wings that recently boiled to the surface. My lack of libido as she would call it.  I was single for a long time before we hooked up and I had lots of sex with lots of different girls - sometimes I went without for up to a year just out of being busy and not really having any time to play the game any more. So when we got together it was electric - lots of sex, lots of passion.. Fast forwards 4 years and i haven't really been into it with her as much.. Dunno why, I still get turned on etc but not as much by her. This really worries me as I WANT to desire her, I want to come home at the end of the day and ravish her but it just doesn't happen. I would never cheat on her and I don't really look elsewhere but secretly in my head I know it's because she's carrying a few extra kilos and I want her to be fit. Dunno why, but that's what I desire in women. I've never told her and I just keep it to myself because honestly I think it's shallow and I love her with all my heart anyway.  Today, it inadvertently came out.. She was emotional and asking me why we don't want sex off her has much as I used to. I skirted around the topic saying I've been stressed and I don't know etc. she said it wasn't good enough and she wants me to look into testoserone injections etc and told me her past boyfriends haven't had any problems with wanting her. This annoyed me because it's got nothing to do with them In the pit of my heart I know the reason is because she's a bit bigger and I want her to be fitter / skinnier. Anyway I knew I had to, communication is the key in relationships right? So I fucking told her, I basically said sometimes her behavior turns me off sexually but mostly I wanted her to be ""fit and healthy again"". She got upset and asked me if I mean that I thought she was fat (which I dont think at all) but it was too late.

I separated myself from my step mother for 5 years when she stole my car and had me sleep outside in 90 degree weather for 2 months when I was 17. I was convinced this time she has changed and genuinely wanted to help me get through a rough time.  I was also under the impression I would be staying at her house two days. She kept me there 5 weeks and refused to let me leave. In the mean time she was following me around harassing me, making fun of my anxiety and panic disorder. I would go outside and not say a word, she would follow. Constantly being right in my face belittling me.  June 14th, the day my mother passed away one year ago. I was crying all day her and my father were fighting, and all her anger is always taken out on me. I was packing my things because my father finally agreed things have went too far and as I was packing my things not saying a word she was right in my face screaming at me calling me a bitch and to 'go fuck my dad'. She then proceeded to call my deceased mother a slut and saying things such as 'fuck your dead mother, she was a piece of shit'.  Not really sure how to react when you are being held unwillingly, being harassed for 5 weeks and can't escape -trying to ignore things but anger keeps building because you can't get away.  Normally when angry, you're suppose to remove yourself from a situation, do coping skills and try to relax. However after being trapped for 5 weeks, and the circumstances it was hard to just ignore.",l

I left for school for the first time, not to mention that as far as he's concerned, he's lost his dad. He is mad at me because he has to go to the woman's house, but I don't. It's been a stressful time. Anyway;  My girlfriend just told me today that since the unfolding of these events, I've  been getting more and more distant, cold, and angry. I honestly haven't noticed, but of she says it, then I don't doubt her. But the problem is that she said I've been making her unhappy (with the cold distance and anger).   So how can I fix this?

5b8asq,5b8asq,Vittra666,"My ex and I broke up in September and I moved out of our apartment. We had two other roommmates as well (another couple). Everyone is willing to sign whatever they need to in order to let me off the lease but the apartment complex says they don't do that and that even after moving out, I'm still responsible for the apartment. Is this legal? Can they refuse to let me off the lease even when everyone involved is more than willing to sign me off? They're all still living there until the end of the lease, just not me. Ex and I are on okay terms, nothing was hostile but we don't talk anymore except when we need to (still trying to get some of my stuff back that I missed). Honestly our roommates were gross and I don't want to be responsible for the damages that will inevitiably occur due to their negligence. I already talked to someone at the leasing office about eveything and they said I should mail them a letter staying the date I moved out and why so I have evidence of me not living there anymore, which I did, but I don't want to get stuck having to pay for damages or pet fees (they're currently hiding two cats from the landlord or whatever). Is there anything else I can do to get my name taken entirely off of the lease? Is their refusal to let me off even with ""permission"" from the roommates and ex legal? I've never heard of anywhere refusing to let someone off if the other people are willing to sign for it. Any help or advice would be appreciated since I'm really not sure what to do about it.",l

I found one I liked, submitted an application and paid the $80 app fee. What I did not pay were the deposits, holding, or admin fees. I also did not agree to move in, I simply told them I was still looking. On my application I listed a move in date, as is pretty standard procedure. After I was approved, they told me I needed to pay a holding fee to reserve the apartment. I did not pay this fee or tell them to reserve the apartment. I did not put any form of deposit on the apartment or sign a lease agreement.  &gt; Fast forward to today, my listed move in date, and I had totally forgotten about these apartments, chose another, and have already moved in. I got an email from the manager asking if I was moving in tomorrow, i apologetically told him I wasn’t saying I picked another complex. Then he sent me an email with the gist of “since you did not move in, we could not rent this apartment because we were holding it for you, and have lost money. For this reason, you owe us $225 for the admin fee, give us a check immediately.”. I have yet to respond and feel that I shouldnt, and just send it to a lawyer. They have my credit card information from when I paid the application fee, for which they used a web portal. I also have an enail receipt showing I only paid the application fee and no deposit.

Use your imagination, example being my gf cant stand bowling, but lives going hiking. Explain that you know you made a mistake, and are willing to make it up to her. If you can accept all the blame up front, then good. If the relationship is in trouble, then do what you need to do to save it.  Of course, this is my advice from my experiences.

She really led me on, though she may not have thought she was. I was totally crushed by this and it hurt really bad.   But I still hung out with her a lot, hoping to escape that friend zone.  I was also a virgin, and I felt really embarrassed about being turned down by a girl I spent so much time with. So I lied to my friends and told them we hooked up. It was totally dumb and ridiculous.   I've kept the lie going for this whole time just to, ahem, not be a liar.   We hung out again recently and I felt really guilty about this.

Finally, idk if I'm the best person for this advice, but since no one else has replied yet, I am, and I think if you make it clear to her that things like watching the stars all night with another guy (an inherently romantic situation) make you uncomfortable, it seems like she should respect that and try to avoid those situations.

After two years together, one would think that there wouldn't be a *desperate* need for you to call her.   Here's where it can get complicated. She needs to realize how needy she's coming off. While you seem to be a rational person, she obviously thinks differently on this subject. What I would be concerned with if I were you, is if she's getting this worked up over a rather insignificant issue, what happens in an actual serious problem?   Having been through a number of relationships (I'm now married) I've gone through a variety of personalities, some of which have done exactly, or something similar, to what your girlfriend is doing. Since some of the behavior of the previous woman I've been with made no sense, I reallized I can't just write it off completely. They are people too after all despite their non sensical reasoning. What I've learned to say is something along these lines:  Them: -freaking out over something not worth anyone's time of day-  Me: ""I understand this bothers you. And while I may not understand exactly *why* it bothers you, that doesn't mean we can't work together to find a compromise.""  Sometimes, that disarms them. Sometimes, you get a good insight to how much they value you if they try to get the solution to go 100% their way.

I'm 22, she's 19, we're both young I know. But I always felt like we were meat to be. She had crushed on me for years in high school, years later we date, we were perfect for each other. In my opinion, still are. Our personalities are extremely compatible. She's my best friend and I'm hers. Anyways, it's been over 2 years since we started dating. I was her first. About 1yr 6-7mos in, I got annoyed with her because she was very clingy, asked for a ""break,"" but she flipped and I broke up with her. My intention was to get her to chill out over some stupid little things like demanding I text back all the time super quick. Anyways, About 2 weeks later we are talking, I'm thinking everything's gravy and I tell her I missed her, she told me she realized her mistakes. But then I find out while we were broken up she fucked some dude. I flipped and more months couldn't get over it and this led to many arguments. Anyways, that incident and my reaction did a number on her. She started thinking about the dude, sorta developing feelings for him, even though she was never anything more than a one night stand to him (this clear from his actions/communication or lack thereof towards her). It affected her self esteem, and me not letting go maybe caused this in her (self esteem and feelings for him) and it helped in pushing her away. So the las 2-3 months I've been trying to rectify this, but she's still slightly caught up on him, but more so on just the fact that she's only 19 and needs other experiences. This from the same girl who a few months back told me i was the only guy she loved and wanted. She tells me she still loves me, but she thinks she needs to figure herself out. The worst part is part of me understands this I guess, but I'm feeling lower than dirt right now. She means the world to me. I don't even find myself attracted to other girls anymore, even ones who are physically more appealing than her. I feel like there's no point to anything anymore. She means the world to me. So idk, I mean, tonight I brought it up and somewhat angrily said if she needs new experiences to have fun and that maybe someday we can try again. But I obviously don't want that. I just don't know how to move on from here. I would do anything to win her full love back, but how can I? I sure as hell have been trying. Any feedback would be nice, at least I may feel slightly less alone than I do now. Also, I made this throwaway b/c I was embarrassed to use my usual acct. Thanks to everyone who responds.   Everyone said I should move on, I feel like I maybe should also. I was even the one to say we should, she's been unable to let go even thought she's the one with commitment issues. Anyways, I just don;t know how to approach this. no breakup has ever been this hard for me. Should I cut her out of my life? She's my best friend. Should we just still be friends and talk regularly (we spend all day talking, texting, facebook chat, etc) and just be open to the fact that both of us will be seeing other people? I wish so much I could have her back and things be like they were before :/",r

m4sci,m4sci,mr_postman,"m/27 here, the relationship is 4 yrs old.  When we began meeting each other, I was an independent, bright guy, knowing what he wants from life. In her I love her ""depth"" - we can talk for hours and she can give me some really good advice. On the outside she's also a great people person - everyone who meets her, loves her. She doesn't handle critique very well (because of her self esteem I guess).  But on the other hand, she has a terribly low self esteem and is fighting depression all the time. And with every single year of our relationship I feel that I'm more and more closed, my self esteem is lower and lower, and my work life is getting worse because of all the time I spend coaching her through her bad times.  I'm afraid of speaking up in our relationship. I'm afraid of dancing with other girls at the parties (something I absolutely love doing, I used to be a great dancer) because she's so jealous. Hell - I felt compelled to explain myself when I hired a good looking girl to work in my company.  I'm still with her because with all that bad things comes some great stuff as well. The biggest thing - in spite of everything, I believe we've built something, and I feel that she understands me (at least the parts I show her:), I can easily imagine growing old with her.  tl;dr; Two questions to you, Reddit: - I know I have to open up and be straight with her. Not take her jealousy seriously and party a lot (if I want). But it's easier said than done. Any tips on keeping on strong? - When it comes to giving her a shoulder in times of depression. How much is too much? I get a feeling that if I'm always there for her, she just learns to rely on me, instead of standing on her own feet. On the other hand - I don't want to be in a relationship in which we don't help each other. - Any good books on the subject of relationships you'd recommend?:) - Any tips on handling a girl with low self-esteem, depression or bipolar (she's not bipolar, but she's on a nice rollercoaster recently because of her job)",r

I allowed the children to go with her b/c I had nothing at the time aside from my job.  She is A/D Navy, and had base housing.  I moved back to my home area in Va after a year no reconciliation was attempted on her side, so I moved home to get things together.  After a year in Va, she was reassigned to a ship, and the children were to reside with me while she was deploy-able.  After a year with me, she took me to court for a PL hearing and the children were taken away from me b/c the judge felt I was in an ""immoral"" relationship.  I have been dating the same woman for 2 years and we are planning marriage after the divorce.  She has been living with me due to financial reasons, and helping me out with the kiddos.  The children were living with us for a year.  During that time my current and I have not had adult relations.

pe95d,pe95d,,"My best friend/roommate, ""Abby,"" and her boyfriend, ""Josh,"" have been dating for about a year and a half. They're both in their late teens/early 20s. Now, I've never been a huge fan of Josh because I didn't like the way he treated Abby (mostly just got ridiculously mad at stupid things and super clingy. clingy as in ""call me now or I will dramatically die""). All I really know about him is what she tells me. I've hung around him when he's over and he seems fine enough, but obviously he wouldn't be the same around me as he is around her anyways, although I have been witness to his dramatic-ness, as he texts me when she won't answer, telling me to have her call him ASAP. Abby and I just started college last fall and although Josh is a couple years older, he's not attending this semester. He's living back in our hometown and we live two hours away where we attend school. They see each other most weekends, but I guess it would still be considered a long distance relationship. The weekend before school started (Mid/late August) Abby, my [now] boyfriend, another friend of mine ""Hank"" and I all went over to Hank's house to drink and hangout. I'll skip the dramatic three hour crying session on the floor and get to the part that I found out about a month ago. I was recently informed by Abby that the night we had all gotten drunk, her and Hank had hooked up. By hooked up, I mean she gave him head. Now, I was incredibly disappointed in both of them because Hank had a girlfriend and Abby had Josh. I knew Hank's girlfriend as well and we had been friends through Hank. It took everything in me not to message Hank's girlfriend, but I wanted to protect Abby and they were just drunk, right? Today I found out that she has had sex with three different guys while being in this relationship. Once of these guys had been a friend of mine and she's only met him twice and had sex on one of those occasions while I was away. Another was a mutual friend. And the last happened last night with a guy she recently befriended. I'm just so completely disappointed and just stunned. She was talking about breaking up with Josh for a while, but that has stopped. I didn't even know what to say when she was telling me. I wanted to scream at her and tell her that she needs to break up with Josh. It's just so incredibly fucked up. It was at this point that I realized how absolutely against cheating I am. I didn't have anyone else to talk to since I don't have many friends and I just don't know what to do. I really don't want to rat her out at all. I guess I'm just looking for some way to cope or maybe talk to her about it? I'm terrified to confront her, though, because I don't want her to be mad at me.",r

99a3vo,99a3vo,JFX2,"Just found out all of this information tonight. Sorry for the long post. So a bit of backstory...  ​  I lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in NYC with two other friends from school. One friend, call him Bob, was my good friend and we met on the first day of college. The other friend, call him Jim, we somewhat knew from classes and he seemed pretty cool so we all decided to get a place together. We signed a one year lease back last year from August 1st 2017 to August 31st 2018 for a three bedroom apartment. Everything seemed fine, we got along and throughout the year never had any confrontations, arguments, disagreements, anything. Since I knew Bob since beginning of college we were a lot closer but we definitely were not cliquey or excluded Jim. Bob and Jim would even hang out and go to concerts/go out together without me.  ​  Fast forward to the end of the school year in May, Bob and I graduate college, Jim still has one more year left. Bob moves back home so he puts all of his furniture into storage and empties his room and still continues to pay for utilities and rent. Around the same time, I move down to New Jersey to stay with my family and sublease my room from 5/13-8/18 to my friend who's interning in NYC for the summer. So Bob and I haven't been in the apartment for the past three months (June to August). All the while, my subleaser and Jim are living together, no problems or confrontations. For June and July, Jim Venmo request me for internet for the month as he has been for the past year (our internet account is under Jim's name so he pays the bill then Bob and I reimburse him for our portion) and everything seems to be fine. He cancelled the Internet for August so that's why he didn't charge me this month.  ​  Now in August, we begin to get emails from our landlord asking if we are going to renew our lease. Prior to me moving out in May, Bob and I made it clear that we are not going to be renewing. So now that it's August and our lease is ending soon, I wanted to discuss with Jim if he will be renewing the lease and also wanted to discuss getting my security deposit back and cleaning the apartment, etc. Facebook messenger was my main way of contact with Jim, however I notice that I can't message him anymore. Kind of weird, but I remember during the school year Jim would sometimes deactivate his Facebook because he was trying to cut back the amount of time he spent on his social media. But then I noticed his Instagram, Snapchat and even Venmo accounts were deactivated. Additionally, his phone number was deactivated. At this point, I decided to email him on 8/17 asking him to contact me because we needed to discuss the lease and that he owes money for electricity (electricity is under Bob's name and as with our Internet service, Bob pays and we reimburse Bob for our portion). No response. So then a day later I email Jim's university email, and still no response. So then I find his guarantor's email (his dad) which was on our lease agreement and email his guarantor on 8/19 explaining the situation and to have Jim contact me but got no response. My friend who was living in my room said he last saw Jim in the beginning of August, but Jim was gone when my friend came back from work one day and hadn't seen him since. He had no idea where he went.  ​  As previously stated, from my friend was staying at my apartment in my room from 5/13-5/18. On 5/18 I went to get the keys back from my friend and go to my apartment to see that Jim's room still has furniture in it - bed, desk, and chair. On top of that my friend said that for a period of time in the summer, Jim temporarily moved into Bob's vacant room because it was bigger (Bob had the master). So there was also another bed, desk, and chair in there (Jim brought in new furniture instead of moving the furniture from his room to Bob's). On top of that, there's all of Jim's personal care products in the bathroom, food in the fridge, and other household goods left in the apartment. At this point I was getting nervous because I haven't heard back from Jim but assumed that he was probably traveling oversees and was going to come back to get all of his stuff. After all, I didn't think there was any sort of falling out in our relationship. So I decided to give it a few days to wait and see if I get a response from the emails that I sent but didn't get one.  ​  Today, 8/21, I decided to follow up with the guarantor and sent another email telling Jim's guarantor that Jim left furniture in his room and in Bob's room and I want to make sure that he is going to move it out and clean those rooms before our lease ends. Also, Bob and I want to get reimbursed for Jim's portion of electricity which we covered. But still no response. And after days of messaging Jim's friends to try to get in contact with him, I was able to connect with one of Jim's good friends tonight who informed us that Jim had some sort of beef with Bob and I, blocked both of us on all social media and changed his phone number, and that he already turned in his keys to the landlord, and he is not going to move out any of his furniture or pay us back for the electricity bill which we covered. I'm pretty pissed and shocked because I didn't know that there was any sort of bad blood between us and now I am stuck cleaning up Jim's mess. Obviously Bob cannot help me since he is back home overseas. What should I do?  I definitely don't want to have to move out all of his furniture but at the same time I know that if I don't, our landlord will hold/deduct our security deposit because it's not completely vacated. Anything I can do legally? I honestly want to screw this guy for doing this but I don't know if taking it to court is worth it considering I'm fresh out of college and don't have much money.  ​  **TLDR; lived with two roommates, lease ends August 31, one roommate ghosted my other roommate and I because of an apparent beef, refuses to move out any of his furniture/clean up, refuses to pay portion of electric bill**  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT:   Need thoughts on this plan - when we signed the lease, I was the one who cut the certified check for one months rent + one months for security, meaning Bob and Jim both gave me money for their share, and once I had their money I got got the certified check and gave to our landlord. This means that I should be receiving the security deposit back in 5-7 weeks after we move out (I'm going to be confirming this with management today).  So two options that I was thinking about --  Option 1. I leave all of Jim's things in the apartment knowing that management is going to deduct amounts from our collective security deposit. In 5-7 weeks when it is returned to me, I will give Bob and I our full portion plus reimbursement for electricity (assuming that there is enough for us) and give Jim the remainder. The only risk I am taking is that Bob and I won't be receiving our full portion because management deducted a lot from our deposit  Option 2. I just post all of Jim's things on craigstlist, facebook marketplace, etc. for free and try to have people pick up all of his stuff. Jim already turned in his keys so he can't get back into the apartment and has doesn't know what I'm doing with the stuff since he blocked me. Then once I move out, I receive the security deposit 5-7 weeks later which would not include any deductions from Jim's left behind furniture, where then I will give Bob and I our full portion + reimbursement and the remainder to Jim.  Thoughts??  &amp;#x200B;",l

He's very supportive of me and my goals, but when I ask about his goals he goes quiet, or starts talking about my future again.  He'll make grandiose claims about my future, and when I try to respond in an optimistic yet realistic way, he'll shoot me down and insist on his extravagant vision.   He's been unemployed for a year now, and has put in exactly three job applications, half-heartedly, over than span of time. I worry about bringing this up, because he'll shut down and get defensive. I'm terrified with what will happen when his unemployment runs out.   Whenever I make a decision, be it about my business or a project or any other thing, he'll undermine me. He'll offer to do something to help me, I'll say no, and he'll do it anyway. I can't be mad because he is doing something nice, but it's something I didn't want.

e9nra,e9nra,rthrowaway23,"So this is part-question, part-vent, sorry for the length.  My GF and I have been dating for over three years.  A lot of that time has been long-distance, however we call each other several times a day and video chat, etc.  Usually we try and see each other in person once a month however the last few months have been harder for both of us so that hasn't happened as much.  About six months ago I moved there for the summer, however I had to come back.  I'm a student which keeps me where I am, and she's got a job and family where she is, so neither of us have moved.  All of this to say, she's not a psycho, we've had a great relationship overall, etc.  For the last two weeks or so, I've been feeling under increasing pressure from her to come and see her.  I told her I would take a week off over Xmas to come down, but she keeps pressuring me for more.  Today I got a txt that said ""Why are you leaving so quickly after christmas when that's a perfect time to spend with me… is [work] more important than time with me?""  I've had a similar conversation or conversations with her for the last ten consecutive days.  I guess I just feel like she's placing 100% of the blame for the problem (us not seeing each other) on me.  I understand she's concerned about us, etc., and it's fine to vent that a little but when every day we have a conversation about why I'm not spending more time with her, I think it crosses the line into nagging and putting pressure on me.  I've told her once or twice it would be nice if *she* came down and saw *me*, but I would **never** bug her about it every day nor would I, if she offered to come down for a week, pressure her every day for even **more** of a sacrifice.  But that's what's happening to me, and I feel like I have to run myself into debt for her or be unable to pay bills for her to be happy.  I finally texted her and told her that we need to have a talk, but I'm not 100% exactly what I want to say.  I need to say something, because it's starting to get out of hand, but I don't know how much of this she really needs to hear and how much of it is just me bitching.  Thanks, Reddit.",r

ed17g,ed17g,complicatedjaguar,"So without boring you guys with too many of the details, here's the jist of the situation. I've been talking to this girl for about 10 months now, last night she came over to my place since we were throwing a little party for a few of our friends. We both have a few drinks, spend the majority of the night with each other exclusively and I figure hey why the hell not, and make a move. We're in my room, on my bed, I go in for the kiss and she actually responds pretty favorably. Things start to get a little heavy, and I start to get a bit nervous because I'm still a virgin, and haven't really had a serious encounter with a girl in a while. So I decide to tell her that I think she's awesome, and that I don't wanna mess things up by moving too fast. She replies saying that she feels the same way, and that she's told her friends about me and everything, but wasn't sure how I felt. So long story short, she spends the night at my place, we pretty much just cuddle the rest of the night and she leaves the next afternoon after a little parting, goodbye kiss.   Now my problem is, where do I go from here? I know she's interested, and so am I, but I don't want to come off as too needy or clingy. I honestly haven't been in a serious relationship before (aside from a debacle of a LDR which lasted just a little shy of a month) and I'm kinda inexperienced when it comes to taking things to the next level. Do I just play it cool, and let things play themselves out? Or should I play a more active role in spending time with her, and what not? I know I'm thinking way into this, but honestly some advice would be appreciated. I really care for this girl and I don't wanna fuck things up.   tl;dr: Finally made a move on a girl I've crushed on for a while. Found out she is into me somewhat as well. Spent the night together, although things didn't really get past first base, not sure where to go from here. I guess if I had to label our situation, I'd consider us ""seeing each other""...but I'm not too sure where to go from there mostly due to lack of experience.",r

1erwjh,1erwjh,Locrin,"Some backstory.      * I am a loner.  * I am a virgin at 24.  * I don't enjoy large gatherings of people, loud club music or anything much where socialising is the agenda.  * I had some clumsy and unfortunate attempts at having girlfriends when I was younger which left me with huge anxiety towards anything romantic with every women I meet.        It has been crippling, and has affected every part of my life. I have had suicidal thoughts several times and long periods of time where I could not muster the strength to find work and just laid on the couch doing nothing while my bank account drained. I still have a scary fascination with climbing up to high places and just standing on the edge feeling alive. I am way too stubborn to kill myself though, don't worry. I just sometimes feel like dying would not be so bad.                    I do enjoy travelling the world with a few friends, I do enjoy a good book, I enjoy exercising, I love my family, I enjoy my current job, I am a huge geek and spend way too much time on the computer. I have several close friends who I talk to a lot.         **I met my first girlfriend one week ago.**                   She ended her 3 year relationship with an ass-hole boyfriend that cheated on her three times about a month ago. Turns out we have both had feelings for the other for some time, but we have both been very polite about it what with her being my colleague and in a relationship. We have not done much of anything yet, she has slept in my bed twice but did not seem to be in the mood for any more than any cuddling which is fine by me :3. I mean if I've been a virgin for 24 years, what is a little more time going to do?                             So all in all, some touching on my part, and some short and a few long kisses. She seems very shy, and with me being so inexperienced it is very hard to know when to do what. I am always the one initiating contact. She seems okay with it in private, but she almost seems to avoid me when I try to say goodbye in public. I can pull her back and kiss her and she kisses me back and smiles after, but it feels kinda awkward when I basically have to claim kisses from her instead of just sharing them at natural points in the day.                     I decided to talk to her today, and ask how she felt about us. She said she was a very shy person, and since she just came out of what was basically an abusive (mentally) relationship she did not want to rush into a new relationship. And I am completely cool about that. I try to be a supportive and friendly person everywhere I go, so I really don't have a problem with this. What I do have a problem with is if I should accidentally back off too far and become just a good friend.                           I really need some tips from women and men who have found themselves in similar situations, and advice on where they failed or succeeded.

eeddx,eeddx,imnotsureanymore,"So we've been dating for over six months, almost seven.  She got gonnorhea. She went to the OBGYN last friday, black friday, and got the results back tonight. She has it, it's on the paper.  So naturally, I didn't know what to do. We talked about it, and I guess it's easy to clear up.  Thing is, I've DEFINITELY been monogomous. I even asked past lovers, no one's had it, they've been tested. She's only slept with one guy before me, whom she doesn't think has it, and she's going to get him tested.  I asked her, several times, if she had been with anyone else. She swore up and down that she hadn't been with anyone but me.  On the phone, when we were talking about it, I asked her several times more, she said she hadn't, and I told her that I loved and trusted her, and said that if this relationship is going to work, we need to continue to be open and honest. We talked a little bit on and off, and she started crying several times, claiming it was due to stress and this whole situation.  Thing is, as far as I know, you can only get Gonnorhea from sexual contact.  I haven't been tested in years, but I did after my last girlfriend, and before this one, and hadn't slept with anyone in between, or anything even close.  So, is she cheating on me? Is it possible to be a carrier and only a carrier? I'm so confused about this whole situation, I don't know what to do, whether to believe her, or anything, really.  Someone, please help.",r

rbrid,rbrid,fortomorrowedie,"I'm a 19 year old woman in what I thought was a spring fling with an older guy before he goes off to grad school next year (he's 23.) Early on, he told me that he didn't want a serious relationship so close to when he was about to leave and so I came in expecting something casual.    Before Spring Break we would see each other about weekly and cuddle. Otherwise, he would not contact me at all. No talking on the phone, no visits after class, nothing. During Spring Break he didn't talk to me, and was actually a little abrasive when I tried to call him on the bus ride back to college.   After Spring Break our relationship became sexual, and his entire demeanor toward me has changed. He's now texting me and inviting me to hang out with him nearly every day. I have no idea what happened or how to deal with it. Does this mean that he has developed deeper and more intimate feelings for me? (Again, I came into this expecting something rather casual.)   Another issue is that he wants to save actual sex for ""something special."" I find that attitude a little strange in a casual relationship. I want to have casual sex with him right now but I don't want to pressure him into doing it if he's uncomfortable. I'm also worried that if he has developed strong feelings for me then I'm gonna have to hurt him by explaining that I don't feel the same way about him. He's a great guy to cuddle with and hang out with, but I wouldn't want him as a long-term boyfriend.  I'm really scared he's gonna drop the l-bomb or something.   And yes I am aware that this is an age and gender reversal from what usually happens in a situation like this. No I don't understand why either.

The very first time we went out alone we ended up having our first kiss (and second, third, tenth..) -- but next time we get together she suggests we should be friends for another three months before we kiss again.

Fast forward a couple awkward months where we didnt talk much, despite working within 100yd of each other every day (although we didnt actually see each other due to being different depts)... We start talking again pretty regularly after i got her a birthday card (i think because she realized i wasnt upset?). Now a month later i somewhat jokingly ask if she'd fly across the country with me to spend an extended weekend in new york city. Of course i expected her to say no but was thrilled when she said ""lets go!"". I made her think about it overnight but she had the same answer the next day. So i booked the flights!

Until this point i dont think ive said or done anything that would make this trip anything more than friends.

ipzg9,ipzg9,,"Long story short: typical 10-year friendship turned unrequited love because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. She asked for her space so I told her she wouldn't hear from me for three weeks.

I've been through this sort of thing before and in retrospect it would have been easier to tell a girl like this ""goodbye"" from the very beginning. The usual consensus in these matters seems to be to just move on; I concur. I don't really think I have any other choice and it seems to me that she terminated the friendship by being less of a friend to me when I showed interest in being more than a friend. I always made it pretty obvious that I thought the world of her. This is the hardest thing I have to do but I know what trying to save the friendship is going to put me through and I can't do it.

lib52,lib52,,"So, my best friend (a guy, I'm a girl) of &gt;5 years has been engaged to a really great lady for over a year. I've only recently started hanging out with this girl, but these two are so perfectly matched it's ridiculous. Anyway, my friend has been talking about me more and more often to his fiancee, to the point where it worries her. When we hang out now, he tries hitting on me (touching+ hugs galore, pissed when other guys get near me, tells me how attractive I am, etc.) He asked once if I would kiss him, just to relieve some sort of tension or whatever, but said he genuinely loves his fiancee. I really believe he loves her a lot, and I know she loves him. His fiancee just texted me, asking what she should think. I want to say something to him, but idk how not to be awkward about it. I still want to remain best friends with both of these people. Help?  Tl;dr: Best friend has been making the moves on me, is engaged. I want to confront them about it. What do?",r

I wanted to tell her how I felt about her, but decided not to.  I thought she'd want to be single for a while after such a lengthy relationship.  Plus, I wasn't even sure that she really had feelings for me..  Then, to my surprise, she got a new boyfriend.  I decided I had nothing to lose  and finally told her how I felt.  She said that she had been into me for a while, but thinking I only liked her as a friend, ""put it in the back of her head"".

Give a 24 hour written notice and inspect. Take photos.  Noted, however it was a tiny patch of mould and the unit is a basement unit.  They complained once, it was fixed...and then they never complained about it again - until now.   Should we inspect the unit now?   &gt; Not sure if locking the laundry room would be seen as reasonable, but I assume it is unlocked now.  Yeah, this was not correct for us to do.

It's been more than 20 years since I worked law enforcement, but such warrants were generally not in the national database at all or they were listed as ""adjacent states only."" You see, if Texas arrests you, Arizona has to pay to transport you -- so Arizona may limit their outlay.  Trouble is that there is no way to know.  Still, if I were you, I would do this.   1.  Contact the arresting agency and explain what you think happened.  2.  See if the agency will cooperate with Houston PD in straightening this out. 3.  Figure out what biometric data (fingerprint, photograph) they have 4.  Figure out what crime details might help (who, where, when did it happen) 5.  Get the arresting agency officer's name and contact info for Houston PD to contact him. 6.  File an identity theft report with Houston PD. Bring everything you have -- ID, witness from work (in person), evidence proving your presence in Houston at the time of the crime (proof in receipts or credit card statements). Ask the officer to take body photos showing scars / marks / tattoos or the absence of same. If you have suspects as to who stole your identity, give as much suspect information as you have.  If you want to hedge your bets, bring about $10K bail money (you will get this back once it is cleared up), but I doubt you'll need it. 7.

2n1uvm,2n1uvm,,A couple of weeks ago I was pulled over on my way to work to pick up some supplies for a job that I was needing for a work related trip just before heading to the airport. Needless to say I was arrested. This was my second offence. First one was back in 2009 along with a DUI felony offence. They gave my 3 years of which I did 9 months in the pen with 3 years probation. Had no trouble getting through probation but now I'm worried about going back in. I've obtained a lawyer which will show up at my preliminary court date set for next Wednesday. When I was pulled over (in my work parking lot) I noticed it was a K9 unit. I got nervous and when he approached my car he could definitely smell the pot that I had so I admitted that I was carrying just a little over a 1/4 oz. He tried to get me to narc but that wasn't happening. Anyways he didn't ask for consent to search my car I suppose since I had admitted that I was carrying but was also never read my rights. So I'm not really sure what to expect. One thing I'm concerned about is the time I will have to get my system cleared out as I assume they will drug test me at some point.

Furthermore, by not talking about this, they are evading communication and starting a non-communicative pattern.    A relationship has to be built on communication and trust. If he can't explain to her that she needs to be more independent, and show her in a way that she can retain her self-esteem, there is very little point in continuing a relationship.    MY ADVICE: Sit her down and explain to her that you love your relationship with her, that you enjoy spending time together, but you want to make sure she is getting the most out of her college career.  Tell her that it is perfectly OK to attend parties and events without you on her arm, and, in fact, that you'd prefer she start doing a few things on her own.  Follow this conversation up by making sure to have dates and spend time together.  Engage her in conversation about her other activities and give her some positive reinforcement for her independent behavior.  Engage in your own independent behavior - have the guys over for poker, or go to a party, or attend a charity event by yourself.    Honestly, if you two can't be independent, your relationship is going to fizzle out and become stale.  What will you talk about when all you do is do the same exact things?

It hasn't necessarily turned things worse either, it just makes things awkward sometimes.

Be assertive, but not too assertive in the case of a divorce and she pins some kind of violent husband defense to take ur assets or whatever.   and seriously man, what kind of ""devoted, loving mother"" goes drinking after midnight, and texts her husband about a ""cute"" coworker. if she doesnt have some deep, emotional thing wreckin her inside for the past two weeks, she is most definitely cheating on you and not wife/mother material.   Confront her and be assertive while at it; dont let her step on you. if she doesnt budge, divorce her, and live on. Stay strong",r

The use or administration on any form of public transportation, in any public place, in a qualified patient’s place of employment, if restricted by his or her employer, in a state correctional institution, on the grounds of a preschool, primary school, or secondary school or any school bus or vehicle.

5gxweg,5gxweg,Backtothefutures3,"My step mom is from Europe and has been married to my dad for two years.  She has had her green card for one year.  Since the beginning it was believed by my family that her intent was to marry an american to get citizenship and bring her daughters over.  She had been manipulating my dad to spend money on her and slowly trying to sign over his major assets.  Recently she over stepped her bounds and requested we sign over his car to her.  When he refused she began verbally abusing him and threatning him to the point he didnt feel safe with her.  She locked him out of the house temporarily and would not give up the car keys after returning home.  A lawyer advised an order of protection and during her manic episode thats what he got.  She didnt expect it.  She swiftly went to the ATM after and withdrew the money in their joint account.  After being removed from the home my dad started planning a divorce.  A couple days later step mom agreed to a divorce only if the order of protection was dismissed through a third party translator.  A few more days went by and she came to get some belongings from the house with an officer escort.  My dad let them in but didnt know he didnt have to.  The officers also served him with a police report from her that he hit her.  The officers did not investigate and said she is not pressing charges.  Afterwards, it was found out she did this to get him to lift the order of protection.   With two weeks before a court hearing to dismiss or prolong the order of protection, we have to decide to either believe she will sign divorce papers or prolong it as we dont want her able to come home and try to accuse him of abuse again.  My dad doesnt want her immigration status to get messed up but also doesnt believe she will sign divorce papers even though she agreed.  Perhaps to keep my dad safe a less intimidating court order like a restraining order is better?  Take the risk and dismiss the court order?    My dad is in his 70s, she in her 50s.",l

It scares me because how are we supposed to start a life together?  We've talked about this before and he says that he plans on going to school, yet 4 years later and he's still not enrolled.  Am I wrong for worrying? I feel like a broken record.. He says he loves me and will do anything to be with me, but it feels like I'm the one trying to better myself and make this work.

You're going to have so many expectations built up by that point on both your parts that no human could live up to it. And at the same time, the quasi feelings you have for each other would probably be cockblocking any other relationship from forming. Which is even worse since with all that, attraction is still VERY heavily based on physical things. Not just body, but even aspects like smell or minor genetic traits you're not even consciously aware of.   She's really smart to do it like this.

rdur1,rdur1,slobberknockers,"Will try to make this concise: (EDIT: that went well)  I dated a girl for 9 years. We started dating in high school. When we broke up, I had lost my job only 2 weeks previous. Though I felt myself a very strong person, all of that was too much and over the next couple of years I got even fatter (was already pretty heavy), got in massive debt, even had a brush with the law, totally the opposite of the square I was.   Fortunately, my probation required me to take an evaluation and though I passed, it led me to the decision to attend some counseling sessions. Starting about 2 years ago, I have started my own business, graduated from college, lost about 50 pounds, and my self confidence has soared. The counseling helped, if not the main factor, in all of these improvements. I am really happy with myself, except for my relationship status. That is where I still haven't improved myself.  Since breaking up with her, I haven't been out with anyone. I keep making excuses. Up until about a year ago, I was still about 80 pounds overweight. I have always said that I held high standards for the women I wanted to date, and I wanted to hold myself to the same high standards, so that was the excuse for a while. Also, I am very busy with work, school, and other things over the years, and didn't feel that I could devote the time to a woman that she deserved.   I am now in good shape and still find it troubling to even talk to many girls past pleasantries small talk. I don't go out much, as my business takes most of my time and I have many friends where I live.   I said all that to say this. Since we broke up, my ex has been married, divorced, is now living with someone else for the last year. Heard it through the grapevine that she is splitting up with him. I haven't spoken to her in nearly 5 years, but she asks my family and her family about me (I still keep in touch with her parents, they love me). When I was with her, I was completely different. Much more outgoing, comfortable with her, felt better about myself. I had anger issues back when we were dating, and my counseling help with that tremendously.   How big of an idiot would I have to be to delve back into what once put me in a stupor before? I have told myself that I wasn't waiting for her, but now that she is available, it seems I was. I don't know if I can get over the ""what-if"" feeling if I don't pursue her, but I don't know if that is what is best for me and my continuing improvement.   I am not expecting anyone to completely understand my situation, and tried to give as much detail as possible, but was hoping for some insight from others that might have had similar situations.

We would always joke and get in trouble due to us talking over the teacher. We became good friends, but not really ""best"" friends.  Over summer, she admitted that she liked me, and said she'd be changing schools (I had a crush on her all year, and she knew).  When school started back, sure enough she wasn't there, and I just was single as usual, but at the beginning of 3rd quarter she returned to my school for unknown reasons. We never really talked, as we had no classes together. I texted her yesterday, and she said she missed me a lot. I told her I missed her a lot as well (I did, and my feelings for her have returned incredibly quickly).  Today at school, when I tried to talk to her she just kinda nodded me off and continued talking to her group of friends. Yesterday we had about a 10 text conversation before she said ""gtg"".

Once I found out she was single again, those thoughts went away. Not to sound cocky, but I am pretty awesome. Because of anxiety issues, though, I have trouble simply approaching people I don't know.

So I recently started a relationship with this guy, and  though I would never read what he's saying I can't help but see him often on Facebook on his phone having long conversations with a girl. We never talk ourselves on Facebook, but I often see this girl commenting on his status, and as I was curious about her I admit I looked at her profile. She lives in the states, and we are in Canada so I'm not overly worried about that - - but I saw in her pics two pics of her and my boyfriend... Of him kissing her and him holding her and I admit my heart wrenched- even though they were clearly old pics.   I know she's not an ex as he hates all his exes, and I recall reading a post a while ago (showed up on my news feed!) from before we were dating of her saying he better have room for her in his apartment when she eventually comes visit. I didn't have an issue when I first read it as I thought she was just a friend but what's with the kissing pictures?   Am I wrong to be a little upset?

27co7s,27co7s,Serventdraco,"I'm about to graduate with a bachelors in Paralegal Studies and plan to find a job with a local law firm. In basically all of my classes we learned about or were warned about giving legal advice to clients as this could result in sanctions for the unauthorized practice of law since paralegals aren't lawyers.  Once I get some more experience with working in the field I'd also like to be a regular contributor to this sub because I'm very interested in the law as a whole (which is why I'm getting a bachelors in Paralegal Studies and eventually plan on graduating from law school) and think that researching issues submitted to this sub would be a great way to learn more and more about the law, especially since most of it is relevant to the kind of work I'd like to do.

Either way, I went out with a girl a few months ago but she didn't want to go out again so I said ""OK"".  Then I met another girl but she only wanted sex and drink, as good as that may sound, it's not what I am looking for, I want a serious relationship.  I have met some other girls from friends but because there are in the 30-35 range, well, they are already married or in a long term relationship.  I tried OKCupid and other sites, I even paid and no luck, it just brakes my hearth sending out e-mails and see they open the mail but no replies.  I'll be honest, I am a bit fat but not obese still I am not a creep sending e-mails about ""sex"" or shit like that as people tend to do and seriously I want it to start serious, not one night stands.  I used to have a long relationship (7 years) but didn't work out at the end, a year passed by and I am giving a try.  I also go to bars but no luck either, what the fuck is wrong? Yesterday there was this girl next to me and I say ""Hello, English is OK?"", she nods and then I ask ""Where are you from?"", just ""Canada..."" and then she grabs her mobile, so I just keep going with my drink, some people left and she moves to another seat leaving one in between.  I haven't cried for a long time but I couldn't help it, I feel so down, I don't even want to try it anymore, I don't consider myself a bad person, have a stable job, have friends (sadly, not here), just coworkers and a few other guys which I met from time to time.

dtnkrkg,7upqin,KWienz,"Judging from the not-quite-redacted parts of that letter, it looks like it's a template demand letter from an affiliate of [LegalShield](https://www.legalshield.com/ca/small-business), which is basically a bundled legal services monthly plan for small businesses and families.  From what I can tell, for $49 a month, LegalShield's lawyer affiliate will provide unlimited legal consultation, 20 calls or letters, 5 collection letters and 20 reviewed documents.  Given that the company's name is referred to on the letter, I expect this is what happened:  Ex wanted to get money back. He owns a business that sometimes need to collect from clients, so he pays a monthly fee to LegalShield to handle his basic legals and simple collection stuff for him. He gets 5 collection letters a month anyway, so it's basically free and a letter from a lawyer seems more scary. Of course the lawyer's contract is with his business, so the lawyer just frames it as a debt to the business because he's getting $50 a month and he (or more likely an assistant) spent 4 minutes adding a paragraph to his standard letter that is addressed to ""Legal Department"" even though you're obviously not a business. Also see the careful language: the firm has been ""consulted with"" (not retained) regarding the debt. They don't say they will take legal action, they say action will be taken because the client ""has been advised of all legal remedies,"" (aka ""Here is the government's guide on how to go to small claims court"").  So if you ignore this free letter his lawyer sent for him, he will have to hire that or a different lawyer to actually do litigation instead of just sending boilerplate letters. Instead of coming from his fixed cost of $50 a month, it's going to cost him $150 an hour. So my guess is this is just a bluff that doesn't cost him anything.  Your friend's sister can ignore the letter or send the lawyer a response saying she disputes the debt and suggests the issue be taken up in court. Either way, the ball will be in ex-BF's court. He can't get a lien unless he sues your friend's sister and wins, either by knocking his claim down to $5000 and going to the civil resolution tribunal or taking it straight to small claims.   Unless he actually does that there's not much to worry about. This was a free letter prepared from a template in a few minutes by someone who probably won't be retained for any actual litigation.",l

She's out of her fucking mind and if you don't either help her get her head straight or leave, you will be miserable.  So when you say that you went to counseling, you went together, but you said that she was told that she was right. So did you go together but have separate sessions?  And it's absolutely true that perception is everything. For instance, my birth mother is pretty nutty, she thinks that our whole family is against her but it's all in her head. But she went to a psychologist for a time and because she told him her slanted view of things that left out all of the good my family had done for her, of course he agreed with her.  If you do try it again, do something where you're in the same room together.

Even if the entire police department refused to act to enforce the law against OP, though, you don't need an arrest in order to prosecute for crimes (in this case, child abduction).  Similarly, CPS can't give OP permission. What CPS can do is take the child temporarily and place him either with a relative (in this case, sounds like the grandmother) or in a shelter until a hearing can be held for the child's placement.  You are correct that OP can't just leave. He/she has to call someone. He/she could call the grandmother to come stay with the child; that's not abandonment, and it's not abduction because OP isn't moving the child.

hbji4,hbji4,,"(My other posts aren't posting, so this would technically be a 'triple' post. Either way, just post here if you see any of my other boards floating around)~  I've been in a relationship with a guy for just a little over a year. I love my boyfriend very much, and I care a lot about his feelings, and our relationship (outside of a few little arguments here and there) is going great.  Here's the problem- I'm sort of crushing on one of my friends. Here's the bigger problem- he lives in a different state, and we're friends through a MMO game. We talk on Skype for hours, every day, and I've known him for a little over a year, as well. I'm not sure if he likes me or not, but there have been subtle hints, here and there. He's gotten gifts for me, and has planned a few little surprises, which have meant a lot to me, and have been super unexpected, and welcome, considering my boyfriend is not really the kind of guy who goes out of his way to surprise me.  He's coming to my state to check out a college (which is really close to where I live), and to visit family, and of course, me. He'll be here for only a few days, and in that time, I'm going to see him.  I'd like to hang out a few times with him, without my boyfriend being around, and I don't want to necessarily sleep with this guy, but I want to find out how he will act around me without my boyfriend being around. Also, I sort of want to kiss him, but I am afraid that is an awful thing to do since I'm already in a relationship.  I know I have a lot more in common with the ""internet guy"" than I do with my actual boyfriend, whom I've still got a very strong and healthy bond with, and I would never want to do anything that would hurt him, but I'm afraid my curiosity is taking over.  Any suggestions/hints would be really appreciated, I'm in a tough situation. Like, is it worth the risk of potentially letting this other guy know my feelings, or should I just drop it and live my life as I already was?  Oh, an additional note- my boyfriend knows the guy is coming down obviously, and has talked to him a few times before, so they know each other, and are on friendly terms.   I know some of you people will say ""Do what makes you happy"" but, hurting my current boyfriend will make me unhappy, and possibly missing out on an opportunity would be just as big of a let down, as well.",r

When we do have sex, he almost never finishes. For the past 6 months or so, I have been hinting at engagement rings or talking about the future and he laughs it off and says I'm bring stupid. If I randomly tell him I love him, like while we are watching a movie, he laughs before he says it back. Most of the time if I don't get a hold of him for plans, we don't make plans.

cel88qk,1urbho,,"&gt;Any advice would be helpful. I've been without a license for over 6 months and they are finally getting around to my case.   These charges are serious. You need to get an attorney if you want to have a reasonable chance of defending yourself against these charges or mitigating their effect on your record.  As far as not having money to afford an attorney. You also earlier state you had no money to pay a traffic ticket but somehow still had a bowl and at least time and potentially money to waste on recreational drug use.  Can you sell: phone, xbox, clothing, watches, anything else? Can you cut any expenses? Can you work more hours?  If you really need to find some money for a lawyer and cannot imagine how, you may want to post on /r/personalfinance with your income and expenses asking for some ideas.  The reality is that if you do not have money, you need to stop doing stupid things that even financially secure people should not do. Why?  1. You have no money. Things like a traffic ticket escalate when you have no money, and can result in things like license suspensions. Without money to deal with it, even small stuff grows. 2.  If you are doing things that are foolish and illegal, you may need a lawyer. If you cannot afford a lawyer, these things are more likely to have harsher more expensive consequences: jail(cannot work much in jail), insurance costs, finds/court costs. The worst thing is that this could end up looking very negative on your record, limiting your ability to get future employment.  That is not to say things like speeding, driving around with a bowl, and smoking pot and then driving in general are things I would recommend doing. However, from a legal perspective doing them when you have no ability to cope with them financially puts you in an even worse legal position as you then end up not being able to handle the consequences.  Anyway, best of luck I hope you work to get your finances on track and make better decisions in the future.",l

1et2x7,1et2x7,,"I would really like to hear from female redditors that went back to their SO, or from males that actually won their SO back. But everyone is welcome to advise.   So my wife and I are going through a very civil and friendly, if you will, divorce.  I filed for the divorce in early April. I became tired of her lies and lack of commitment to our marriage. They weren't big lies (at least not that I'm aware of). She had told me of an email between her and an ex coworker that they exchanged after we separated. Very soon after we separated. He said in the email, 'I know you'll probably end up deleting this account and say you can't go through with it. But I know you can. You'll always be my number one, no matter how long it's been.' I asked her about what he meant and she said they had an inside joke that if they were to ever mess around, they'd be their number one choice. This was an inside joke from about three years ago. That's when she really started changing. So some of her lies may have been to cover him up. I don't know for sure, but I think they were. So I can't tell you how big her lies really were. I think they were bigger than I know.   Anyways, fast forward to now. We've been separated since early March. We've been to a few mediator meetings and are agreeing to split everything 50/50. Kids, finances, cars, everything. I moved back in for two weeks and she agreed to move to an apartment. I'll keep the house. She's been in her apartment about 3 weeks now.   I have recently realized that I still want her back. I have told her how I want her back. How we can wipe the entire slate clean and start over. No living in the past. We have been talking and she's aware I want her back. She says not right now. She wants her 'me time'. She says she's always been with a man and is ready for some alone time. She doesn't want to have to answer to anyone, a husband/man.   The bad on my part is, I became smothering, controlling, jealous. It had pushed her away. She doesn't want anything to do with that anymore. I have told her I will be more trusting, less controlling, not so smothering. All I ask is she show an effort and make me feel like she will never put anyone or anything above our marriage. I asked for commitment, trust, and devotion on her part. That in turn would allow me to be the husband she has been wanting and needing.   She says the door isn't closed, but it's going to take time. Her heart isn't in it. She loves me and cares for me. We still have sex about 2 times a week. We see each other on a daily basis on the weeks she has the kids.   She says she wants us to work on a friendship and trust for now. Then we will see about reconciling. The problem I have with that is, I feel like in the meantime she's going to allow herself to get close to another guy and I will be left behind. She swears she wants nothing to do with a guy. It's killing me to not be able to have her back. To be able to tell her I love her. To hold her. To see her every evening when I settle into bed. I have many sleepless night due to this. I'm going through hell. I just want her back.   So with the possibility being there, that we can reconcile, what can I do to win her back? To convince her to commit back to our marriage. To try again. She would stay living in her apartment, we would just be more of a boyfriend/girlfriend type of relationship. And that's all I need right now.   I know the right answer is to give her her space and give it time. But I am literally dying over here waiting. I need this to happen sooner than later, if possible. I know everytime I talk about it, it's mostly likely pushing her further away.   Is there anything I can do to win my wife back, sooner than later?",r

d8zdjq1,58cq7n,pfeifits,"Your friend needs to find a personal injury attorney.  Note, this is not the typical scenario for those attorneys, so she may need to meet with several attorneys.  Almost all offer free consultations (or initial visits).  Virtually all will take the case on contingency, meaning they will front many (if not all) of the costs in exchange for a percentage of what she wins, but that does not always mean ""free"", so she needs to make sure she understands how costs will work.  That is not my field of law, but the question in those types of cases is 1. if the daycare owed a duty to the child (they did), 2. if the daycare breached that duty (I think they most likely did, but that depends on additional information and might be disputed), 3. whether the child suffered an injury or damages (yes) and 4. whether the injuries were caused by that breach of duty (it was).  Lawyers will fight about how much damages are and about the breach of duty, but the thing to do now is to call personal injury attorneys and find one that a. will take the case and b. your friend believes will do a good job with the case.",l

We are both very young (24 and 20), but have had enough relationship experience to stand out to each other as something wonderful and unique. We fell in love at first sight.

It's been only 5 months, but I know that I can't be as happy with anyone else. I want to propose.   It won't be out of the blue either.

h17ae,h17ae,throwaway8879,"The reason I am thinking about ending it is that she has changed drastically as a person since we started dating. it has been 10 months now and when we started she couldn't seem more happy with me. Everything was great, we hung out alot, had tons of fun, and she genuinely seemed interested in me. Now though, things have changed. We had a LDR for one semester of her being in Iowa and she said she didn't like it there etc. etc. etc. and that she was depressed. Fast forward to January and she has talked to doctors and is back home and on Zoloft. But I feel like the Zoloft has changed her. Admittedly she is alot more confident about herself now and seems to be happier but I feel she has started to neglect the relationship. She doesn't seem like she cares about ""us"" when we are apart but when we are together she is overly affectionate. She doesn't call or text even half as much as she used to. We used to see eachother about 4-5 days a week and now its maybe 2.   When we talked today she said that she knows that she changed and that she knows that it has affected me but she is sorry but she feels better than ever. I told her that I don't know why she is throwing me away and seeming like she doesn't care about the relationship and she said that she does care and she doesn't know why she does the things she does that adversely affect me.   I can't lie, I have been pretty unhappy for about a month now. She just doesn't seem to care or even want the relationship to work although she claims that she does. I don't know what to do. Am I being dumb and should just accept this new found happiness self esteem even though she is kind of tossing the relationship to the side?

I did almost all of the remodeling myself.  We never married, but were together many years.  &amp;#x200B;  Almost a year ago we split up, and at first we were going to sell it and just split the profits (the neighborhood and real estate market has skyrocketed). Our realtor ran comps, knows the neighborhood well, and drew up paperwork for a sale price that I thought was a bit high, but he knows his stuff. We were VERY close to signing the paperwork. She hesitated because she considered buying me out, then she changed her mind. Then I decided to keep the house and buy her out because I figured out a way to do it financially. The idea was I would pay her half of what the proceeds would have been if we were to sell it at that price the realtor came up with.  &amp;#x200B;  At that time she went ahead and got an apartment, and I've since been living in the home.  For various reasons (we each work long hours, and I think wanted to avoid an uncomfortable process until after we were ready) we have yet to get this done.  Our split was amicable and she has clearly been in no rush for me to pay her anything, even though I've offered to give her some cash upfront but she said she can wait.    &amp;#x200B;  We decided to get the ball rolling, and I just got an appraisal. It came in at significantly higher than what our realtor wanted to sell it at about 8 months ago. This blew me away, and I thought it was a typo, but the comps don't lie. Houses have been going for more and more in recent months.  &amp;#x200B;  My question is, do you think we should go off of what we were super close to listing the house at almost a year ago when we split up?

I just found out that for the last two months she has been cheating on me, with some man who has been helping her out and giving her a shoulder to cry on when I'm not there. I learned that they have been sleeping together for the last two months. For her, it was a comfort thing, and for him it was very serious. I believe she is telling me now because he began trying to make it very serious.   I love this girl more than anything and despite what she did, I know she loves me too. You may dispute that, but it's what I feel. It's just so hurtful to think that she betrayed me for so long and it wasn't just sex, she was letting this man believe there was something more there between them.  She broke up with him today (I have evidence of this happening) and I've made her swear that she will not see him ever again, or talk to him online. She seems extremely remorseful and I do believe that it's me she wants, not him. She could have had him, and from what I understand he has a lot going for him that I do not, but she chose me. That does NOT make it okay, but it gives me just a bit of hope.  I'm angry, upset, I feel sick, I'm shaking, crying. I'm going to see her in a week or so, and we're going to see what we can salvage of our relationship.   Am I completely delusional? Or is it right of me to give this another chance.

d0othiy,491de9,Memomo145,Companies that have this have very high turn over and fire lots of people. Google the company and see if there are ripoff reports. Ofds are most people dont last a year. Recruiting is sales. It has constant turnover. The training they give you will just be employee bullshit and will have no value.  Do they say what the full time employee salary and benefits are in writing? Also odds are there will be unwritten pressure to work more than 40 hours and not get paid cause if you get fired you have to pay.  This is a scam. Please post company name. I work in IT.

jb9fa,jb9fa,,"My girlfriend of a year and a half just got back from overseas and things aren't quite the same.  Backstory: Before she left I went to visit her, which went very well. We had a great time and when I had to leave it was a long goodbye where she made me promise to not fall for another girl while she was away. A week later when she was about to head to the airport she had a huge fight with her mother which ended with her having to take a cab to the airport. I talked to her right before this and would have picked her up myself in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I live four hours from her, so it was out of the question.  Flash forward to the present and I decided to meet her at the airport because I missed her a ton and because I didn't know if after the fight she had her mother would be there for her. We spent three days together at her house before I had to leave. (It would have been longer but her mom gets touchy about things like that.) On the final night we went for dinner and a movie after she and her mom had another falling out over supposed unaccomplished tasks that she and I had done earlier in the day.  The day went well after that, with a sushi dinner and wandering around a mall before the movie showing, and her using me as a headrest at the theater since she was tired. We returned from the house just after midnight to find her mom waiting at the fence gate where she tried to pick another fight with my gf about leaving the things we had just washed outside overnight and about staying out later than we had promised, at 10:30, which had never actually been spoken. I was told I had to leave then, as opposed to spending a little more time with her before I go, and so we shared a rushed goodbye hug and a kiss.  I leave for a friend's house since I was planning on staying another day with her and couldn't stay at her house and go to bed upset and frustrated at her mom for ruining a perfectly good day picking fights and the next day I try to find some way to see her quick before I head home to pack my things to move into my apartment for the rest of summer, which I decided to do to spend more time with her after spending most of the summer apart. There was no way to see her and she's been sort of unresponsive to texts the way she used to be.  After giving the background in the most coherent way I can right now I just am left wondering what's going on? We still have plans in the future together and she's considering living with me if she can't take home anymore, but the communication leaves me wondering. I love her more than anything in the world and the thing I fear most is losing her. I just want to know if it's just reverse culture shock still in effect or something more. I feel distant and want to close the gap, but I feel like if I try too hard after having such a long time apart with little communication that it may just drive her away. I've been worried sick about this for the better part of two days, to the point I start actually feeling nauseous at the idea that she may have found someone else.  What do I do, reddit? I want to rebuild what we had before she went away, since I think it might have fallen a bit, but I don't want to be the clingy boyfriend. I want to make her happy more than anything. My plan is to give it a week or two and just act that way we used to and if she still feels distant then talk to her. It's all I can think of and I just need some good advice. I don't want to lose her and will fight my hardest to be with her. I just don't want to think our relationship is on the rocks just because of some culture shock. I'm asking for any and all advice from anyone who's experienced something similar.  TL;DR: Sorry for the wall of text, but the situation needs to be understood. Please read it.",r
c2qgygn,l67qw,i_can_haz_throwaway,"If it's something that people are confused by/aren't used to seeing, that's one thing, but 8/10 comments on this post are just downright insulting the poster's character. One person flat out called her a bitch, another says she's a terrible person and should let her boyfriend go find someone who appreciates him, and still another told her to go fuck herself and reminded her that there are millions of women out there who are abused in their relationships daily. I don't think this girl deserves all the verbal abuse she's getting from 80% of the commenters.   Is it an unusual situation? Maybe, maybe not. I'm certain there are other people in the world who are going through the same, but also feel like/are told to get over it because it's not a problem or it's not something that you should complain about. But personal space *is* a problem in a relationship, especially when one is invading the other's. So why should she be made to feel guilty because she wants some space and wants her boyfriend to cool it with the clingyness?   I can only assume people are taking offense to the way she worded it, though I think she did a good job explaining the situation: she loves her boyfriend, she misses the friendship they had between them (which isn't unjustified; aren't most good couples also best friends? Don't most people turn to their significant other for a shoulder to cry on or to chat things out without expecting an overly emotional ear?), they just started living together and being around each other in a more intimate, one-on-one environment, and she needs some space. She tried to give as much detail as possible, but maybe it was an overload of detail and some people are reading too far into it.",r

19s052,19s052,,"Ok so I will try to write what's going on in my life without making it a huge wall of text.   I started dating this girl when We were 18. Things were great between us but I always had anxiety due to family stress and school. She would help me through it all time. Her family life was pretty shitty as well and she ended up moving in with me and my family (family was ok with it) after being with me for a year. Over the next 2 years things got increasingly hard for me and her. Financially, mentally, emotionally etc and it put a strain on the relationship. My father has bipolar syndrome and his moods were extreme and there was so much tension in my house because of it. She would see my family treat me poorly and I guess it made her have resentment towards them. I was pretty much supporting myself and helping her a little with bills but not much.  I guess I sort of imploded. I couldn't handle all the family stress on top of trying to manage my own life and relationships and I got really depressed to the point I wasn't taking care of myself or taking her advice to make things better. Things got bad between us and she broke it off  ( looking back I don't blame her).  So fast forward a year. I got my shit together. Got a good job, bulked up in the gym, and have been genuinely happy. We've both dated other people in that time.   So here's the thing. We seen each other once last week and we kissed, held hands and all that sappy shit for the first time in a year. It felt right though (maybe because its easy to go back?) We discussed maybe taking things slow but it ultimately ended up in her saying she wants to remain friends because I'm a totally different person now from who she fell in love with. And it actually hurt when she told me that.So why the fuck do I care so much I seriously don't get it. I'm not a bad looking guy I've been with plenty girls before her and after we broke up so why do I care so much about this one?  Sorry for the run on sentences and rambling. Thanks for your help",r

6aonq6,6aonq6,fringeofchaos,"I wasn't sure whether to post this here or /r/personalfinance, but since they shy away from legal issues, I'm erring on the side of caution and asking here. I'm also asking for my father, who doesn't have a reddit account.  My parents were divorced about a year ago. It was fairly amicable, no lawyers were involved, and my father described it as a ""boilerplate divorce"". They lived together for a little while after due to money issues, but my mother eventually moved into her own apartment. During their marriage, they came into $16 thousand in debt. About $10 thousand is owed to the IRS, primarily from my mother's paychecks not having enough taxes taken out, and another $6 thousand in a credit card. The card is a little complicated. It's tied to the account of my father's cousin, who was helping my parents out on a move. We've never had much money, and when my dad got a better teaching position down south, he had to move down four months before their current apartment lease was up. This card helped them pay for everything during the transition, both for getting the apartment they shared, and paying for expenses on both sides. The card itself is in my father's name. The IRS debt is apparently in both their names.  Now we come to the problem. Right now, my father has been making payments on the debt, and my mother has been paying her half. However, she's been living paycheck to paycheck (just like my dad), and her brother (a hundred millionaire) found out and decided to pay off half of her debt, then simply have her pay it off $100 a month with probably no interest (not sure on that last detail). What this means, to my parents, is that he's going to pay half the card debt, and half the IRS debt, and let my father take over payments. This would make her free and clear, but leave my father with payments twice as high, and eventually paying more due to interest over time. He's obviously not thrilled.  I don't have the details on the divorce verbiage regarding debts, my dad didn't have the divorce papers on him and is going to try to get them tomorrow after he gets off work. As I understand it, the credit card is harder to justify, because it's actually in his name. The IRS debt is a little stranger due to most of it coming from my mother's paycheck, and being in both their names.  I personally think it's a little weird - since after the divorce they didn't get separate accounts to pay off the debt, each making their own payments, I can't really see how my uncle paying off her debt isn't just ""paying off half the debt, now they *both* owe half as much as before"". Hiring a lawyer isn't really feasible, like I said my dad is living paycheck to paycheck and trying any sort of legal battle against a hundred millionaire isn't going to happen.  I'm hoping we can convince my uncle either to A) simply take over her payments and change nothing, or B) pay off the debt entirely and put both my parents on the same payment plan. It's not like my father's a pariah, he still comes to my mom's side of family get-togethers. But still - I'd like to know, with what paltry details I've been able to provide, what my dad's situation looks like, from a legal perspective. If my uncle does in fact just pay off half of the debt in each account, does that put my mom in the clear and my dad on the hook for the rest? Without knowing any other details (I should be able to get some tomorrow) what sort of options does my dad have?  EDIT: Sorry, forgot the location. My parents live in central Texas. Original location was north Texas. Never lived anywhere outside of the state for the duration of their marriage, or after.",l

There's one guy in the group, i'll call him Nick', who used to stare at me a lot in class. Once when we were reviewing each other's short stories, he said mine was his ""favorite."" A girl friend of mine in class said he liked me/wanted to get to know me but i'm so quiet. We only spoke 2-3 times after that, he always initiated the convos and it was always awkward cuz I ruin things by being shy/stuttering, etc. Anyway yesterday was the most we've ever spoken and I'm starting to wondering how he sees me, or what he wants from me. Friendship I can only assume, since he has a gf and mentioned her a couple of times but his behavior towards me seemed a little ... flirty? plus he seemed kinda nervous  - on the way to lunch Nick walked beside me, and said he said ""hi"" in class earlier but I had my headphones in and was looking down, plus I sit so far away."" (He's mentioned that I sit far from him twice now. -_-)  - in the restaurant we went to on campus he sat beside me, when there were other empty chairs  - he asked me what I thought he should order because he trusted my opinion  - asked me about my business (i run a shop with my sister) and said it was cool that we owned our own store  - Nick asked me if i liked videogames and what kind, so i started listing some and we got interrupted by others, so he asked me again and mentioned he works at a game shop so he could get me discounts (he offered to buy the games I want for me and we could meet up)  - he invited our friends out this friday for karaoke and then asked if i wanted to come too  - during a convo one of my friends said that before she knew me she thought i looked really cool, like i dressed stylish etc, and he agreed  - at the end of the lunch i left first and gave my two girl friends hugs, he quickly stood up from his chair to hug me goodbye, and hugged me pretty tight, but let go before I did. -_- lol  -- p.s. i'm 22, he's 20",r

n0tin,n0tin,shesnutsandilikeher,"Hi guys, M(20) here, looking for some advice on how to deal with my F(20) friend.    We've been really good friends for a couple of years (at college), spending a ton of time together (both the two of us and with friends), etc. She has some serious problems. She's flirted with depression, had an eating disorder, has the biggest daddy issues i've ever seen.  I've been there for her as the friend to cry to throughout it all. That's all I've really wanted. A few months ago I started to feel something different.   I sounded it out with a deniable drunktext. She responded by freaking out, the next few weeks sucked. Ok, fine, not interested, OK. I moved on. Mostly. Fixed the friendship by denying any feelings, things were good, still had the feelings.  This week has been hell. She threatened suicide on Tuesday. Took her to professionals, they calmed her down, things looked up (as much as they can do...)  Thursday we celebrated her feeling better by drinking with friends. She got way too drunk, I took her home. She drunkenly made a move on me (a few times), I stopped it. Put her to bed. Went home.  The next night she went to a party with other friends. Came back to my place where I was drinking with friends, completely hammered. In the midst of being upset about her ex, she confessed to having feelings for me, and being really upset that I didn't feel the same. Well, shit.  Talked to her the next day. No memory of anything after getting to my place. I gave her a rundown of the issues with the ex, didnt mention her confession. She expressed relief, said she was afraid she might have said something stupid about a guy she liked.  Earlier tonight she told me to leave her alone for a few days (she was embarrassed about making a fool of herself this week), she needed some space to figure things out. Ok, fine.   Now, reddit, what do I do? I like her, she likes me, I would feel so much better if I could be there for her in every way she needs me.  Or is it as simple as don't stick your dick in crazy?",r
kpuo6,kpuo6,,"20, male, heartbroken.  Tonight I drove home completely drunk. Why? Because I have nothing else to lose.  I need help reddit, and I have no idea where to start. I recently had a relationship I thought was solid fall to pieces. It wasn't a long relationship, but it ended so suddenly, that I never saw it coming. Yes, I miss her. Yes, it sucks. But what hurts me the most is that I cannot deal with being single. At all.  I feel that nobody wants me. I feel that nobody wants me around, or even gives a flying fuck about me. Every relationship, EVERY ONE, ended with me either being used, walked on, or just shoved away. It's as if people get to know me, then don't like what they find. Help me figure out what to do. I feel so lost, and yes, I am still drunk, but for the past 5+ years, I have never had a moment where I have been happy, unless I am in a relationship.  So I come to you r/relationshipadvice. How do I feel okay being single. I've tried, for so long. I can't wake up feeling happy. I can't. I always wish that someone would fucking care about me. Someone would stick around. Someone would appreciate what I have to give. How. Please. I can't take this anymore. I feel so broken.  Disclaimer: Drunk, so I'm emotional. But it's all true. I need help. And I have no idea where to start. :( Yes, I am young. I've heard the whole, ""you have so much to live for"" shit, but that's not the point",r

I just want something more stable, slower, with a chance to manage other writers in house.   I've written a considerable volume of content and I am very proud of my work.   Right now, my website has a ""writing samples"" page with a short synopsis with a pdf attached. I don't have any content I've written for this job (really lazy updating the website).

There isn't a clause in my employee contract that mentions licensing and legacy.   I want to host the content because I feel silly pointing recruiters to the company's website. Also, I'm a bit paranoid the content might be lost (server issues, crashes, next writer tweaks it, etc).     Since I can't find the clause, I am going to go ahead and do it and see if I run into trouble. I have never had an issue hosting content I was commissioned to write as a contractor on my own site.   Back in my publishing job, I was aware of ""non exclusive/exclusive"" publishing rights.   The only concern I have is SEO and duplicate content.

I am in a long distance relationship with a girl who lives in Australia. She is 17 (recently) and we've been together for only a few months now.

If I did want to leave her it would be seriously difficult because i feel like that would cause her to start self harming again.

Since he left yesterday he would not text me at all, even though he used to text me all the time before. I just texted to ask if he would like to go out today and no response whatsoever. I don't understand , he was the one desperate to meet me, promised me we'll go out a lot even though I didn't say anything about this and so on. Now he suddenly changed and I don't see a reason for it as we got along absolutely great yesterday. Help?",r
gczxd,gczxd,,"We are both 24.  We are in love with each other.  I am going through one of the worst stretches of time in my life - I lost three family members in the past month, and I am far enough behing in a PhD program that I am at risk of losing my funding.    Despite all this, I think I am doing pretty well for myself.  I've acquired an incredibly high tolerance for frustration, and I can (fairly) easily let go of things beyond my control.  I rarely rarely rarely dump my problem onto other people.  I make a conscious effort to keep my problems my own.  I've been dating this same woman for about 3.5 years now.  For about a year, she has been a real bummer to be around, and it has been getting worse.  It turns out that her dad had some sort of personality disorder, and she's developed some [codependency issues](http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/go/codependency) because of it.  Like, I can't be upset about **anything** around her without her feeling, on some level, like it is her fault.  This causes her to shut down.  I told her that one of the things I need, right now, is to have a little bit of fun.  I invited her over for movies and dinner at her favorite restaurant.  Halfway through she broke down crying and had to leave.  She told me that she's so anxious all the time that she can't ever relax, and that the entire night she was worried about how much fun we were having.  I know she prefers to be alone, but I didn't know that it had gotten to the point where she doesn't listen to vocal music because it reminds her of other people.  It feels like I spend all of my time trying to cheer her up and do things for her.  At first I was just calling it a loss; we all have ups and downs, and I'll help her along until we can get to the good times.  It's been a year though, and those good times aren't coming.  I'm at a point now where I could use some support, and I am really not receiving it.  I've put a lot of my own happiness aside, and I am worrying that I've made the wrong decision.  I don't want to kick her to the curb, but I don't want us both to go up in flames either.   What should I do?  What would you do?  What more information can I tell you?",r

I knew that if I drew past my venmo balance it would come out of my bank account so I used that. My bank contacted me and said I overdrew and that I needed to pay the bank so I went and paid them with the overdraw fee and it was all settled. Now, 6 months later, venmo sends me an email saying I owe them 100 dollars for the overdraw and that THEY covered it not my bank even though my bank said I overdrew from my BANK account and I paid them back. My venmo account is now frozen for a fake debt. My old bank account has since closed so I don't know if I could get the overdraw debt payment records from them. I don't what to do. Luckily I only have 20 dollars in my venmo account and keep my money in my new bank account. Do I need to pay this false debt or can I just leave it frozen because I don't really care about the 20 bucks?

She likes to meet new people (not for sex) and has maintained a profile on a dating site to try to meet new people. She met a poly guy that claimed was only there to meet new people too. Anyways, its clear that he was into her and I felt really uncomfortable with it. I dont want to restrict her ability to meet new people as its something she really enjoys.   In the past, Ive ruined relationships by holding girls too tight. I get the feeling Im doing the same thing to this one and I really dont want that to happen. I have a low self-esteem some times and thats generally when it gets worse. I really need some advice on how to fix myself and the relationship.  Thank you in advance.",r

ckt9avh,2hjfb1,Brad_Wesley,"&gt;THANK YOU i have some additional questions if you dont mind.. what might be the legal ramifications if we do nothing(no pony, no sell out)?  There would be a provision in the original working interest agreement.  If she can't find that then she should ask for a copy.  Most likely she would be diluted down by the other working interest owners who do pay up.     &gt;is this legal?  Yes.  It is legal and common.    &gt;my family has invested a substatial (to us) amount of money, with promises that we would be paid back in full and receive extra money as well,  It's hard to know.  When you are a working interest owner in a well there is no guarantee at all that you will make money as many wells fail.  Plus you mentioned a bankruptcy occurring at some point.     &gt;they have made good on neither, how can they ask for more money? (i realize the difference between immoral and illegal)  Because the well needs a capital expenditure.  There could be any number of reasons for this.  For example when you drill a well and it starts producing the amount of oil pulled out of the well declines every month.  Sometimes it reaches a point where by spending more money to re-frack the well it can increase the flow for a while longer, which can be a good investment.    &gt;would selling out for 3,000 cut us out for good? (if it does it looks like the best option) would we still be eligible to sue them if we sell out?   Yes it would cut you out for good.  Bear in mind that you can always ask them for more than $3,000.  Might as well say you will sell for $5,000 and see what they say.  Selling out is the best idea because as a general rule you shouldn't invest in things you don't understand.  As to being eligible to sue I don't see how selling out would pre-empt you from suing over past conduct unless part of the agreement to sell specifically says that you won't sue.  It is important to note that while you may have been scammed in some way there is nothing that has been revealed here which indicates that.  It sounds like it's just a well that didn't perform as well as hoped.",l

1eky01,1eky01,atastandstill2013,"THIS IS A VERY LONG STORY Here's a timeline and some facts. I am going to sacrifice grammar for speed. Please don't attack it, lol. Known husband, Derek for about nine years, met through friends. After five years, started dating. Together 3years, proposed. Married last summer. After honeymoon, all downhill. Looked like drug abuse, addiction. Refused to get help. We had other problems too, like communication and sharing responsibility and stuff. Many chances thrown in my face, i filed for divorce in December.last week was day for final filing of Divorce papers. I frantically called lawyer to put on hold. Been thinking about Derek for a few weeks, wondering if things could be different. After many conversations over past months, it is now clear that he was very depressed, we were both essentially lying to ourselves about our happiness levels, he was self medicating at the time. Is now doing much much better, trying hard to get a job, do odd jobs for money, has a part time gig too, no longer using the problem substance. Still attracted to him, talking about maybe working on things together, seing a counselor. Know it will take time and effort. He will never make a lot of money which is really important to me (among other things, some of which he excels at, and some of which he sucks at). I'm looking at a future which is not my dream life. So, that's Derek.  In late January, I started dating Matt . He is very smart, educated, funny, makes good money and is taking steps toward his future. He lives a healthy lifestyle (very important to me, which Derek wasn't so good at..he smokes and doesn't take great care of himself), he's funny and treats me like gold. The future I see with him is bright and full of the things I want in life:a house, an equal partner, vacations, the security I need to start my business..... So...what's the problem right?  Problems... -I keep thinking about Derek. Sometimes even when I'm with Matt -Matt is overweight. It bugs me. He is healthy, active, very muscular and strong. He watches what he eats (for a guy), enjoys physical activities, and keeps an eye on his health in general (preventative care, stuff like that) -Derek does not have a good track record with regards to accountability, ambition, motivation, attentiveness, responsibilities, etc. he seems to have changed a lot, is willing to seek counseling with me. I don't want to build castles on promises.... -Matt has three years left in his PhD program, sucks to wait, but huge ""payoff"" obviously...  They both make me feel so wonderful in different ways. They both are attractive in different ways. They both have a lot to offer in different ways.  I have talked to those people in my life whose opinions I respect and value, ad nauseum I have made a list of what I want in life, to try to organize my feelings. I've made a pros and cons list about each, to no end. I've spent time with each of them recently (they both know), and haven't had any epiphanies.... I'm losing sleep, and having trouble concentrating and thinking about anything else....  Any advice, ideas, tools, anything that might help?

pooby,pooby,,"About a year an a half ago, I began dating this girl I had met in summer school. Instantly we liked each other and we soon started dating. We dated for about 11 months, fell in love, I was the happiest guy in the world,  until one day she broke up with me in the midst of an argument. Exactly 6 months passed by, and through though six months, she dated 2 guys and I had strong feelings for one of my friends, but none of those relationships worked out and we eventually realized that we wanted to get back together, at the same time. What I mean by that, is at at one point I wanted to get back together, but she said no, and then she told me she still had feelings for me and she still couldn't get over me, but I told her no because I had strong feelings for this girl. Eventually, we both came to terms at the same time and I told her we could get back together under one condition, and that condition was for her to do something to prove that she actually loves me.  Here's where my problem starts. It's been over a month now since we got back together, and at first we were really happy that we got back together, and all of the joy and happiness came with. One of the main problems that we had before, is that we argued a lot, but now we don't argue at all, so it's not like things are going bad. We picked up right where we left off, like not a single day had passed when in reality exactly 6 months had passed. I'm happy, she makes me happy, I make her happy, everything is more than just fine.  But for whatever reason, this past week, all of a sudden I feel like having a girlfriend has kind of become a burden, but I have no idea why. I love her, she makes me happy, I wouldn't ever want to give her up again, whenever I see her, I smile and if I could I would spend a good deal of my day with her, but for some odd reason sometimes I just even want to talk to her. For the past 6 months, all I wanted was her, and now that I have her, I have this feeling like I don't want anything to do with her, so I purposely ignore her or push her away because I feel overwhelmed by her.  I'm sorry if I'm not being clear enough, feel free to ask me anything if you need me to clear anything up.

cevz0fc,1vtmn3,salapeno,"I found at your age that it was pretty hard to have things to talk about if you spent a lot of time with someone already. If you see each other at school, and afterschool, and weekends, then you kind of already know everything that is happening to them. Then what's left to text about?   I would suggest trying to make sure you leave time for yourself to try a new sport, meet some new people, or join a club, and don't just text her while doing it. Enjoy the experience and then later you will have something interesting to talk about.   I would also ask what you do together when you hang out. Do you just watch a movie or sit around together? Perhaps you can try something new and learn it together. Find a class on rock climbing or break dancing or cooking for teenagers (lots of cities have great free/cheap youth programs) and go together. Shared interests are a great way to get closer again and generate something new to talk about or do.   Otherwise, if you feel that's just not going to work, there's really not much else you can do. You could ask her why she seems distant lately and talk through it, but keep in mind that at your age it is fairly common for people get strong feelings, or lose strong feelings, and not really understand why. I used to fall in love every month with someone new, and just as quickly out of it, without knowing the reason.   Keep your chin up. Sometimes things just don't work out. And that's okay.

z1yp9,z1yp9,,"Guy here. Married 5 years. During our first couple months married, I was talking a lot with another woman I grew up with. Childhood friends. She was married at the time. She was texting me about how her husband wouldnt have sex with her and how it had been so long since she had any.   I didnt tell my wife that this woman was telling me this. My wife sees the text messages. She rages and calls the woman. They fight over the phone. Wife tells me to never talk to said woman again. Out of respect, I abide to that request. To this day.   I feel weird because I genuinely feel that I've lost a friend. I feel bad that I can't talk to someone I grew up with.   I would like to add that this woman did cheat on her husband and got a divorce. Party's all the time and has a kid.    What say you Reddit?",r

If possible, one of you should take a trip to the city the other is in, but make the trip not all about meeting (although that will obviously be a component of it), but also about seeing other friends in that city, doing some tourist-y things, etc.  Just try to stop yourself from getting too emotionally invested before an in-person meeting.

d6c1m2y,4x2qs8,JaxGal17,"Sorry to hear about your illness.  Best wishes for successful treatment!  There are four traditional documents in an estate plan:  last will and testament, living will, durable power of attorney, and health care surrogate.   1.  Will:  This is where you leave all your stuff to who you want.  If you don't have a will, your stuff will be divided according to statute which goes spouse, kids, parents, siblings, in that order.  Once you have a will properly executed, you can always leave a handwritten note dividing up your personal property like your baseball cards do to Susie and your book collection to the school. 2.  The living will is the pull the plug document.  It allows you to state you want them to withhold nutrition and life saving measure if you have a terminal condition or are in a persistent vegetative state, etc. 3.  The durable power of attorney is only valid while you are alive.  If gives someone the power to be you, so make sure you only grant that to someone you trust implicitly not to screw  you over.  You can limit the length it's in effect and what powers you want to grant, ex: they can access your bank account but not sell your house. 4.  The health care surrogate appoints a person who can make medical decisions for you if you're unable to.  Again, someone you would literally trust with your life.    Also, make sure all of your bank accounts, life insurance, 401k, etc. have beneficiaries listed.  All of those items can pass outside of your estate meaning no need to include it in a probate case.  In the event of your death, your beneficiary shows a death certificate and ID and gets a check.  People forget to do this all the damn time and then have to go to court for a bank account with a few hundred dollars in it.   When I did all my own estate planning, my family would need to go to court to get my car, that's it.  Everything else is set up for beneficiary payout.",l

We had know of each other beforehand, but she had been dating a guy for most of the time I knew her (2 years), and I wasn't used to her being single.  Anyway, I danced with her, got her number, and texted her the next day.  I asked her to dinner and she said she'd think about it.  After a few days, I asked her to coffee to see what was up.  She thought I was graduating (taking a 5th year in college because I changed majors) and was much more wiling to get dinner, but she had plans for that Friday night to see a male friend at another college, but she was interested in dinner with me.  That Saturday night, she gets back early from seeing the guy at the other college, and I go to see her at a party.  We spend the entire time together, I walk her home, kiss her goodnight, then go home.  The next day, she wants to see me.  We see each other all week, and establish that Friday, after an event hosted by my fraternity and her sorority that we'll see each other.

I can't deal with the never-ending sadness and irrationality, regardless of whether it's truly his fault or not. He won't get help, he refuses, 1) he doesn't think he needs it and 2) he's been in institutions before and doesn't believe in psychology. He believes it helps some people, but that it's just not for him. He's extremely grounded in his beliefs.  I've had to pull rope out of his hands convincing him not to commit suicide. I've watched him go into a bathroom and cut himself and come out bleeding.   I'm not depressed and this is seriously bringing me down.  It doesn't help that he has no familial support, doesn't really speak to his family, doesn't like them at all. His friends mean practically nothing to him, and he doesn't hesitate at all in telling me that I am the only person who he cares about/ who he feels has ever truly cared about him. He was abused as a child and can't let it go.  Every time I've said I can't deal with it, he says he'll change. And I will give him that, the past few weeks have been a LOT better. But I just have this constant nagging anxiety that knows this is wrong and I need out. I just want out.  It complicates things that we live together. If we broke up, he would leave, and quite frankly I wouldn't put it past him that he would kill himself. I can't bear the thought of him killing himself because of me. I wouldn't be able to live with that. But I shouldn't be his reason to live. It's not fair. It's fucked up.  Further, that we live together- I am a broke ass college student. I don't have friends to help me move and I sure as shit couldn't do it all on my own. And if he moves out, I'm missing half of my rent. Although his name is on the lease too, so if he were to do that he would still be responsible for rent unless we find another tenant. And if we didn't, and he were paying to live in two places at once- well shit, I know he can't afford that and I would just feel terrible. But all along the reason I've avoided this is because I would rather live with someone who I get along with most of the time, than take a chance of having a shitty roommate who I don't know move in.

He says he cuts all former girlfriends out of his life completely because it's ""too hard to be around them knowing that he wasn't good enough somehow."" I'm tired of being his caretaker.

1qwh2g,1qwh2g,Shirrapikachu,"My SO and I have been dating for about a year and 3 months. When we first met, I was in a bad place in life. We jumped into the physical before dating, acted like a couple without an ""official"" title because I wasn't sure about a relationship. When I felt sure I could handle a relationship, we made it official.    So, I guess lately I feel dissatisfied. The ""honeymoon phase"" has worn off, and I feel really stuck in a monotonous cycle. Sex life is also very much a pattern. Often I don't get to orgasm (it's not the easiest for me, so I don't blame him for not wanting to spend so much time trying.) so I'm dissatisfied with that, too. I've brought this up somewhat vaguely,  and so he planned this day to pamper me, give me a massage. It ended badly and I sure didn't feel pampered. we were even interrupted by his friends asking to hang out (which we ended up doing :/)   sorry for the rambling. I want some spontaneous things back in our relationship. I don't feel special, I don't feel wanted. I feel bored and unhappy,  even as far as thinking maybe I'd like being single again. I do love him, but our relationships lacking something. He seems totally content and when I bring up things (I'm not the best at expressing my thoughts, especially when upset) we end up in a fight with me feeling like the bad guy for feeling the way I feel. It makes me feel unbelievably selfish for being unhappy. But I don't know if it's alright for me to feel dissatisfied,  cause apparently I'm the only one who is.  I'm a very emotional person,  &amp; am plauged with wicked mood swings that can happen at the drop of a hat (think constant PMS,) &amp; often my moods and unhappiness are unjustified. So that leaves me constantly worrying if the particular thing I am upset about is actually justified,  no matter how big or small the issue.    What does reddit think? He just moved in with his roommates from his family home, and so now I feel uncomfortable being with him. We do get more ""privacy"" and 'alone time,' but I feel nervous (especially regarding sex) cause at least one roommate is always home. So that rules out any new or fun sex exploration.   the routine is quickly becoming ""hanging out alone in his room watching movies/video games."" and lately I find it hard to even get in the mood for sex and don't give in when he initiates, because knowing I won't get mine kind of kills the mood for me. We don't have time or the funds for random spontaneous things, nor has he ever suprised me with dinner or flowers or anything.. which is something id like but have zero idea of how to ask for without sounding selfish.   I guess to sum this up: I feel unwanted and not special, and I'm the only one who is dissatisfied with our relationship (sex included.) asking for my needs to be met makes me feel selfish,  and in general I am just unhappy.

Yes, I have medication, but, no, I'm not currently in therapy. I have a new referral so I'll be restarting that soon. Anyway, I'm having a pretty deep relapse right now, and the last about week and a half has included several breakdowns. Yesterday morning I made the mistake of letting my coworkers know I'm struggling. Female coworker K knows my trauma story. Male coworker E does not. When I said I was having a relapse, K mocked me in front of E and asked if I was talking about drugs or something. I made it clear that I was referring to my PTSD she was already aware of. K then went to our manager and said I came to work with a bad additude, and was trying to avoid customers. The manager is new, has only been there a few months, and does not know my story. I have told him I have PTSD, but not shared my story. Since this manager came, most of our crew has been fired one of them for working approved OT. Everyone is afraid for their job. So he pulls me into his office, calls my work ethic into question, and demands to know my trauma story. I know this is not right, but I feel cornered. I need the money, so I break down and tearfully relate my trauma story. &gt;  &gt; Was this a violation of my rights, or just a shitty thing that hapoened?

But keep in mind these next words, courtesy of my high school calculus teacher who was just an ""ol' hillbilly from the mountains of West Virginia.""  He always said, ""The easy way out isn't always the easy way out.""  **The easy way out isn't always the easy way out.**  A couple months after we ended it, I decided to attempt to win her back.  I put in some quality time, thought and effort into the plan, I made it sentimental to tap into her emotions, and really went all out.  It didn't work.  She had a cold front as if nothing ever mattered (but of course it did), and she rejected it saying she couldn't do that because she had mentally moved on (impossible less than 2 months after ending a 3-year relationship).  In the next 9 months, I took my LSAT, applied to law school, stayed busy working, and made a few friends in the area).  I didn't date again until 8 or 9 months after we broke up, and that was more-or-less a fuck-buddy, and then I had one one-night stand (only reason either one was worth it was to realize that I'm not a HUGE fan of either of these).  I had a summer fling last summer, then ended it when school started.  I was single until about a month ago, when I met my current girlfriend.  I was very patient for about a year, and I have finally found someone who I can truly foresee a positive, quality future with.  We each of ""deal-breakers"" but don't have the characteristics or qualities that violates those.  We agree on every important issue (or at least most, since I'm sure some things will eventually come up).  But to get to the point, I spent over 2 years thinking, analyzing, and figuring out what happened during the course of that relationship to end is such catastrophe. What did I do wrong?  What did I do right?  what could I have done differently? what were the signs early on, if any? But essentially, I wanted to know what I can extract and learn from it all to make sure that didn't happen again.  The conclusions I've come up with work for me -- or at least allow me to sleep at night, and wake up every morning a happy person.  What works for me: Communication is key, and that must be addressed up front.  Controlling the other person is horrible.  It's ineffective, if not inevitably counter-productive, and it's far more work (an infinite amount because it's impossible to achieve) to change someone at their core than it is to be patient in waiting to meet someone who matches you.  Other thoughts:  I carefully selected and am building a wonderful relationship with a very genuine, positive, witty, sexy girl who matches the qualities I prefer and doesn't violate any of my ""deal-breakers"" (which is mostly communication issues and general jealousy.  Heh, I'm not very picky, judgmental, or needy, but I just want a relationship that could actually work).  I'm also in my second year of law school, I have great friends, and I've been happy every day I've woken up for about a year now.  I think it's what they refer to as Nirvana, or what Maslow called self-actualization.  On the other hand, my ex got pregnant four months after we broke up and ended up eloping with the guy this past summer, despite her picturing her dream wedding since she was a toddler.  So, there's the easy way and the hard way.  It seemed I was taking the hard way out, but something told me that swallowing my cravings to seek physical or emotional attention too quickly would not necessarily be in my best interest.  But, this brings up another concept:  When you are in an emotional situation but have nobody to express those too, you're more likely to make bad decisions.  It's like alcohol.  People say alcohol's a truth serum, and whatever you say when alcohol-induced is how you TRULY feel.  Well, I compare that to transferring emotions to someone new, when they're really about someone else.  This doesn't seem to make sense at first, but here's my reasoning:  Without alcohol, we are rational beings.  We have 1) innate desires; 2) emotions; and 3) Rational thought and reason; and 4) our actions we take after we use these rational thoughts and reason.  With alcohol, we are drugged.  We still have our 1) innate desires, but everything else is drugged; 2) emotions are drugged; our logical, rational thoughts become 3) illogical and irrational; and it results in 4) actions we take after we irrationally apply our drugged emotions to our innate desires.  It explains some drunk driving, desire to fight, and our heartfelt expressions of [whatever].  Now, take that whole thing, and replace alcohol with the drug we'll call ""an emotional break up.""  It results in drugged, illogical actions based on drugged emotional reactions to our innate desires.  And, it kinda explains how it's possible for her to get pregnant just a few months after successfully being on the pill for 3 years, without getting pregnant.  It explains why people always look too rebound - they're drugged, illogical reasoning convinces them that they shouldn't suppress their innate need for physical or emotional attention, and they're drugged emotions only encourage this behavior.

eswur,eswur,i_r_confused,"I'm a freshman in college. I met my current ex-gf at orientation over the summer and we talked everyday until school started. We soon started dating and everything was wonderful for the first two months or so. November hit and she started getting annoyed with me over every little thing from hiccuping to looking at my phone to check the time when she was telling a story to drinking the milk out of my cereal bowl. Stupid things. This progressed for a while and she began acting more and more sketchy. She seems to be pretty manipulative and I found out through her best friend that towards the end of our relationship (december) that she had been trying to get her ex-boyfriend to break up with his current girlfriend ""because it's fun"". We finally hit a breaking point and when I tried to reconcile she backed out and left. I prepared for this a few weeks before it happened and got over her enough to focus on other things (finals included) about a week after we broke up.    Break hits, and now she wants me back. She's been telling me how much she loves me over and over and again and how she's completely wronged me and how everything will be great now. We had this conversation on Christmas so I tried being nice but I think she got the wrong idea that everything is perfect again. I've been kinda going with what she's been saying to me since Christmas but I don't really think I mean it. I WANT us to work out but I can't see it happening. Plus, every single one of my friends who knows both of us personally doesn't like her and don't want us back together. They all say she's a bitch, which admittedly she can be. Even her best friend says that she can be a bitch. Just a few days ago she got into a fight on facebook with her ex-bf's current girlfriend. The only thing that's keeping me wanting to give her another chance is how big of a revelation she claims to have had and how she promises to me how everything is going to be great. I've also never been in a situation like this before. Can anyone offer me advice? I'll be more than happy to answer any additional questions.   tl;dr: my ex-girlfriend broke up with me because she claimed we were really different, which we are, I got over her, and now she wants me back and I don't know what to do   EDIT: I talked to her on the phone for about two hours last night and she's completely miserable. ""She's ruined the best thing in her entire life"", that she'll never forgive herself, that it's all her fault, that she would understand if I don't take her back but it's not what she wants, she would do anything to be with me and that she doesn't want to live without me...

54aosc,54aosc,kuhner32,"My situation is somewhat unique and I am interested into what avenues I have left to obtain damages from this individual.   In September of 2015 I hired a contractor to build a pave-stone patio in  the rear of my home. The project was never completed and the contractor filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.  After discovering this, I reached out to the Maryland Home Improvement Commission to begin the process of rectifying the problem. It was at this moment I found out he was unlicensed and had lied to me since day one (yes I know I am naive and stupid).   I immediately filed a small claims against him and his company for damages to repair the project.  The court just reached out to me providing a court date for his LLC to defend itself, but canceled my case against his person. This is where I am getting confused and am looking for guidance:  1.) I know I am probably not going to receive any payout from the bankruptcy trustee as I am on the bottom of the totem pole. His full-time job is with the state, so wage-garnishment is a very real possibility if I were to win a judgement against his person.  2.) I would like to pursue him individually for the damages as well so I am confused as to why the court threw that case out. In the State of MD, constructing a retaining wall and/or stone patio is considered a Home Improvement Project and requires an MHIC license (This information is openly available from the Dept of Labor and Licensing.   It is my understanding that any type of fraud (Lying about your legal ability to perform a job) denies you any protection from your LLC. So legally I should be able to pursue him individually for damages as well, correct?   If so, where do I need to go in order to begin this process? Do I have to pursue him criminally? The MHIC states they can prosecute him, but cannot assist me in recouping my losses.   Thanks in advance for any assistance.",l
kxbrh,kxbrh,IWishIHadAGoodName,"Reposting due to advice from someone in AskReddit:  I've known this girl for a couple of years, and I've been super friendzoned since pretty much the beginning. There was drama at first, since I asked her to a dance a long time ago, and we went and she ended up effectively screwing me over. But this girl is amazing, seriously. I don't know how to describe it. I just haven't given up. So on to what happened. Basically, things led to other things, and I managed to snag her on a date to the homecoming dance. A legitimate date. And so I got her two corsages, one for the actual school day and one for the dance itself. We also went out to eat, and it was great. We went to the dance, it was great. I even managed to throw in a kiss on the cheek. But after the dance, when I asked her if she'd like to do it again sometime, she pretty much in a nutshell said ""I don't really think I can see us as being any more than friends. When we hang out I feel like we're just good friends. You'd be the perfect boyfriend, I just can't see us together."" I told her I would keep trying, and that her feelings about it might change. I really really like this girl, and I don't want to give up.

1qu92c,1qu92c,ThrowAway171113,"On Friday, I received a call from my sister's best friend at about 10:00 PM. I'm 18 and my sister and her friend are both 17. Let's call my sister's friend Helen. Anyways, Helen was having a bad day, parent issues ect. and needed somebody to talk to. Helen lives in the next neighbourhood over, so I decided to walk over to her house.   She snuck out since she was grounded and we walked to a local park. We sat on a bench and she told me about her problems, while I reassured her it would be alright. After this, we picked up a couple bottles of vodka and walked to my friend's flat. This is where my problems begin.   After we had a few drinks, mine straight, hers mixed, she was a bit tipsy and I was pretty drunk. Helen was pretty horny I guess and started talking about how she needed to have sex. Since I had met her over 10 years ago I have had a secret crush on her. I told her that we could fuck if she wants, and she said no. Helen told me that although I'm a great guy and she admits pretty attractive, she sees me as an older brother and couldn't do it.   Although at this point I'm pretty crushed, I back off and we continue drinking. Later in the night Helen ends up beside me and we began to make out. After several minutes she pulls back and tells me that it is wrong and we shouldn't be doing that. Once again I'm crushed.  As the night progresses, I find myself getting pretty touchy feely with Helen. She's drunk, and I'm wasted. What started with feeling up and rubbing her leg, eventually turned into groping her breasts and having my hand inside her pants all the while making out. After a while of this, I began to finger Helen.  She finished relatively quickly calling out my name in waves of pleasure. We stayed at my friend's flat for maybe another hour. We left at about 5:00 AM. At this point I walked Helen back to her house, and she kissed me before going inside. I went home, still drunk, feeling good about the night.   When I woke up, a wave of horror washed over me after remembering the events of the previous night. I called my friend and filled in the gaps in my memory. I feel horrible about it because she kept backing off. She sees me as a brother, and I feel that I betrayed her trust.   I immediately called Helen, she didn't answer, which is strange for her. After talking to my sister, leaving out all of the details between Helen and I, she told me that she got caught sneaking back in and is grounded. Oops. At this point I not only feel bad about what happened, but also because I feel that it is my fault that she is grounded.   Reddit, I don't know what I should feel.

me7vw,me7vw,,"Hey everyone.  So, the title is pretty much my tl;dr: Coming up on two years ago now, I met, through Facebook (under weird circumstances through another online relationship that was coming to an end), a really interesting girl.  She is 20 and I am 22, she was single, and I was newly single; I am male, she, as I said, is female. We really hit it off fairly quickly, and I always felt like there was something special about her. We flirted a lot, got to know and be very open with one another, texted almost non-stop, talked about finding ways to visit one another, et cetera. I hesitated on making a move because I felt like it would have been better to meet her in person before I jumped to any conclusions about how I felt about her based on what happened in my last online relationship; I was already in love at that point, but I didn’t want to mess up again.  Around the middle part of this year, she told me that she’d met a guy, and they proceeded to begin dating. This really hurt me, and it still does. Seeing pictures of them together and whatnot kills me.  However, I know she still likes me. I’m not sure how to explain it so people will understand… we still talk nearly every day. We Skype now and then and I can see it in her eyes (boy that makes me sound insane, but you know how you can tell when someone is into you, right? That’s what I see). She talks about how attractive I am to me and her friends. She opens up to me about a lot of things. And she is trying (she says) to get stuff in order so she can come down and visit me sometime this month. I just pick up all these signs that she’s into me from her.  I’m fairly sure I’m not in the dreaded friend zone here, because I’m almost positive that she knows that I like her a lot, despite the fact that I’ve never explicitly told her so, and she’s never gone out of her way to say anything like “Oh you’re such a good friend,” or make it otherwise clear that she’s not interested in me. If anything, I would have to say that I feel more like I’m next up in the bullpen. =P  Her boyfriend is also, by her admission, a jerk. From what she has told me about him (note that she never ever spoke about him to me until I started asking her about him trying to figure out his quality), he doesn’t support her in things she wants to do, and actively verbally tears her down (I don’t believe in an abusive way, I just think he’s a jerk and is dumb and doesn’t realize what he is saying). For example, he tells her how other girls check him out, or how he prefers girls of different heights (she’s tall, he likes short more) and eye colours than hers. He also still speaks with his exes and receives nude photos from them, and tells her how hot they are and how he feels like having sex with his exes. I get the feeling that he doesn’t appreciate her, and would (if he hasn’t already) cheat on her. She acknowledges that he is a bad person, but will not leave him because she “doesn’t want to go through a breakup” at this time.  I don’t want to be “that guy” and actively break them up, or have her cheat on him or whatever. I want to do this cleanly, because I really care about this girl, and I really want things to work between her and I, but I feel like, if I could just get her down here to visit me, that I could win her over. I’m too afraid to make a move either way until I’ve met her in person and can really gauge her feelings, but there still isn’t a concrete date on her visit (she says she needs to get her passport worked out and that it would be a couple paychecks until she can get it).  I’m gonna be honest and say that I have moments when not the most secure guy in the world when it comes to a woman I like. I really am a confident, laid-back guy most of the time, but now and then, when the mood and time is right, I turn into an insecure, paranoid mess with a lot of irrational fears about her not liking me and whatnot.  I just don’t know… Am I wrong? Is my radar off that badly? Or do I have a shot here? What should I do?  I hope this was all clear. I’ll be happy to clarify anything or answer any questions there might be.  Thanks in advance. It means a lot.",r
cj3op03,2bbhus,,"You can fire anyone.  When it comes to someone who may try for a claim? It is a great idea to speak directly with a lawyer about all of the specifics. There are a lot of lawyers who focus on the employer side of this.  That being said - you're not firing them because they have a condition. You are firing them because of their actions and their activities.  Even having a painful condition does not mean that you can come to work intoxicated. Let's pretend this person was an alcoholic. Would that mean they can still be a delivery driver that's allowed to drink on the job?  It was the employee's responsibility to manage the condition and it's not the business's responsibility to allow an employee a pass on something like this simply because of a diagnosis.  Were there reasonable accommodation made for this employee when they were hired? Is there something in a policy or in a job duty or with a piece of equipment that is ""special for them because of the condition?""   Or is this one of those situations where the employee disclosed ""I have ________ but it's not an issue?""  &gt;After leaving, they got into a car accident.  Good gravy.  &gt;Does firing based on our zero-tolerance policy leave a possibility for a wrongful termination suit?  Possibly but just because someone sues you doesn't mean you're in the wrong.  &gt;They can no longer drive,   can no longer perform job function as a result of something they did after work  &gt;and was endangering our clients,   and you have a responsibility to protect your clients. Make sure you get written statements from any coworker who had interactions with this person before too much time passes.  &gt; but I am not sure how the disability (and the prescriptions) plays into this.  It means they can stomp their feet and throw a fit and you might want to call around and get a lawyer to handle this person if they do.  There is nothing in the law that says because someone has a condition they can OD on a RX to the point they are intoxicated and you have to let them work.  I'm guessing this hasn't been an issue before? - No? That means they can manage the condition without being intoxicated.  Edit to add: You never have to tell an employee WHY they are fired. You can just fire them. When they ask? ""It's not a good fit."" Let them try to prove you fired them for being a drunken monkey on the job.",l

pjvsx,pjvsx,,"I'm from a pretty poor area where almost everybody only cares about alcohol, football, getting laid and television. The general cultural mode entails a lack of care for anything I consider truly important. I'm one of the only people from the area that reads, let alone has any taste. Not to be judgemental or anything but it's blatant and fucking depressing, I've been dealing with it my entire life.  I came to know this girl through chance, and obviously remembered her - and became interested in her in the first place - because she's so incredibly beautiful. I just want to get to know her and try to save her from the dead-end cultural cul de sac that's she has already started to go down. It's not just her interest I have at heart, but my own as well, as my hope is invested in me and her eventually getting together. But, that doesn't mean I don't also want to do the best for her that I can. I really want to help educate her about the finer things in life and help her as best I can to reach her potential; she's sharp; she could do great things.  The main issue is she's eighteen and I'm twenty-four. It's generally thought of as weird where and when I'm from that someone my age would be so emotionally lost in someone so much younger. She's shown some vague interest, but only when there's no one else around.  The problem with that is I don't see her often, and when I do she's generally with either family or friends, with whom the possibility of me and her getting together would probably be a big deal. She probably doesn't want to have to deal with that. I know how people talk... I know nowadays a lot of people think age is a big deal. I wrote her a poem - yes, I'm a dork xD - and have been carrying it around with me in hopes of being able to give it to her. I saw her on the bus today, but she was with a friend, so she essentially ignored me.  Has anybody any idea what I could do to get her attention? I don't want to proclaim my love for her in a situation that will make her feel uncomfotable . But, I also don't want to keep waiting until this whole thing just unfurls and she gets involved with some local yokle who I KNOW will do her little good, and drag her further down in the sad world of booze and idiocy that I so narrowly escaped; while I forlornly stare, as she cruises about town with Scumbag Steve, who will eventually probably fuck her over anyway.",r

You two spent a fun few years together, but its getting to the point where you need to decide if you want to marry her or not.   And she's doing the same right now.  She's off in some other place enjoying the fact that she can go out and get piss drunk, dance on bars and not have some one worrying at home or a judgmental boyfriend glaring at her from the crowd.  My advice is to go out and live your life.  Innocently flirt with girls at bars.  Sit with them, laugh, talk etc.  Enjoy life while you can.  If you don't have fun while your girl is gone you're going to resent her for making you miserable.  But that's your fault.  You need to have fun for yourself.  When your lady gets back from Warziristan or wherever you damn well better have something to say when she asks ""So what have you been up to?""  Responding ""Pining for you"" Is going to get your ass dumped.  She wants you to be your own person and being separated like this is exactly when you go out and be your own person.  Live some stories you can retell to her so she's excited to come back and be tied to you.

But he's well-adjusted and not depressed, so I'm not sure why he doesn't even put minimal effort into it...  When he came to meet my parents he was a complete mess...holey shirt, scraggly beard and shaving bumps, faded old pants. I was pretty shocked at that. Needless to say my parents weren't very impressed.  We never go to any fancier restaurants and such because he doesn't own any nice clothes and rejects my offers to take him shopping. He pretty much dresses like a kid in elementary school.  He always pledges to try to eat healthier and exercise more (he's roughly 50-70 lb overweight, and completely sedentary) since heart disease runs in his family. I go to the gym a few times a week and he'll come with me maybe once before giving up on it.   It just bothers me...I try my best to look good for him, not only because he enjoys it but because I like to look nice. Sometimes it involves wearing something I don't like that much or something similar, but I'm willing to do it because it makes him happy. I don't mind that kind of compromise at all...but it makes me feel like I'm not worth the effort when he barely does the minimum. Although he does shave his beard, which I'm grateful for!   I'm not so totally shallow as to consider breaking up just over his looks, that's ridiculous. And I'm still overall happy with my relationship. But I would be happier if he'd show me that he does care about how he presents himself to me. Asking him gently about it doesn't do anything, he'll just promise to try and then he'll come up with excuses for why he can't or won't. What can I do? :(",r

Dont live together but spend the night 5/6/7 nights a week.  Story is the same every time, we get in an argument, generally over something fight worthy but not big fight worthy.  At first it was once a month or so now its once every week or so.  It turns into this schematics game generally led by her.  I say 1 hr she says it was 45 minutes.  I say she yelled at me she says she raised her voice.  Sometimes she'll sit there and roll her eyes at me, openly.  She does things that upset me then I start raising my voice/cursing (not at her ""fucking couch"" vs ""fuck you"") and then she gets all ""dont yell at me you cant talk to me that way"".  I did curse at her during the previous fight, and here's why.  Hotel after party with 2 friends.  Other dude and I go for a cigar, the girls fall asleep in the small bed.  I try to wake her, come on babe lets go, its late, they are going to sleep, the bed is small.  The whole time she's like i dont want to go, why are you being mean to me, its cold outside.  I tell her she can wait and ill go get the car.  We take the elevator down, i once again tell her - wait here ill go get the car (several blocks away).  We get outside and she walks away from me, faster and faster.  We get to the car and she doesn't unlock my door.  Then she starts to backup and pull forward a tad with me just standing there in awe.  I get in the car totally silent.  Im mad.  Then on the way home she starts talking shit to me.  I tell her to take me home and go to her fucking house.  We then spend 2hrs + on the fone fighting about it and i curse *at* her repeatedly, lots of yelling.  Throughout she wants to keep interrupting me (bad habit of hers) and wants to claim she didnt drive away, and play the schematics game.  Even in situations like this she always somehow tries to shift the blame to me.  **Fast forward to last night**  Shes out of town for a wedding.  I didnt go cause i need to xmas shop @ the last minute.  We dont really talk that much during the day.  Most of it is her complaining about her mom.  She text me that she will call me later.  She txt @ night to say she's after partying (bunch of old hs friends, etc).  I go to the local bar, stomach doesnt feel good all weekend, I leave and come home - intending to go back out.  She calls at 1am, totally drunk.  We talk for a bit, I tell her I plan on going back out to have 1 beer before close.    do note during this entire time her phone is about to die.  *sidebar* : I dont have a vibrant social life and recently discovered this bar.  all the bar tenders are cool - they let me stay after it closes.  shes been there with my several times and met them.  i feel like whats going to happen is my gf went out and had her fun, got drunk, etc and now wants to talk till 2am then is going to pass out and im going to be fucked cause everything is closed.  this is why i told her several times that i am going to the bar.  moving on.    15 mins pass (now 130 last call is 2am) I tell her again im going to the bar soon but we can keep talking till then.  10mins later i tell her :  &gt;ima go to the bar, why dont you get some food/drink/ibuprofen and go to bed  this is where things went bad.  she was instantly upset.  i apologize / it came out wrong.  i go into damage control.  shes drunk and mad, things arent going well.  ""the bars more important than me"" and all that.  easy for her to say she didnt call me when she was out partying, now its my turn to party and she wants to talk.  i talk to her for 20mins more and try to kill the static.  shes trying to split hairs and play the schematics game and im not letting her cause it never goes well and takes way too long.  i drive to the bar, we're still talking.  the call drops, i assume her phone died.  its now 150.  tons of ppl leaving the bar.  i order a beer, she calls, i answer - cant leave the bar because there are literally 20 people standing at the front door.  cant talk/hear her because its super loud.  i hang up.  then we start texting.  im saying im sorry and its very unfortunate and bla bla.  shes not having it, its not going well.  we text the entire time im at the bar.  i dont want to call her because i dont want to get into the same 1hr+ fights we always do.  she tries to call and somehow my phone hangs up, the call ends right away.  10mins later i leave the bar and call her.  i open with a short bit trying to smooth things over, im sorry, its all unfortunate (how i said what i said) bla bla bla.  what follows is the typical 1 hour argument splitting hairs i should have left the bar and called her back and so on and so forth.  usually we come to a resolution, not this time.  we get off the fone with nothing solved.  next day we get into the same convo, solving nothing.  schematics and splitting hairs, her story vs mine.  after 1+ hour of this we get off the fone (shes driving back into town @ this point). i tell her ill call back in 10mins or so.  i dont call back because i dont know what to do/say.  she calls back and tells me shes out front of my apartment.  we never agreed/talked about her coming over but now here she is.  i tell her i dont want to hang out because im/we're upset.  she leaves, and gets really upset. we then argue some more on the fone for another 30+ mins and i say i dont want to hang out mad.  and that's where we're at now.",r

She is Indian and Egyptian and I am white. Her parents disowned her for dating me which i feel horible about and guilty if we ever break up. Here's where things start going bad. Our sex drives aren't the same. I could go every day with her. She is more than happy with once a week. She also, just told me that not only has she been thinking about not goingto Boston, but that after 18 months of bein together total, so 9 more from now, she wants to get married or she'll leave.

In some states, trailers aren't required to have plates, so it's not a big deal to not have it registered. If it changes hands several times, it can be difficult to track down the original owner to get a clear title.",l

Another odd thing is that I called twice in the month of November and have not received a call back.  My questions are; Should I be concerned with this behavior? Is it normal to not keep your client up to date on what is going on? Should I not expect returned calls? If it is abnormal behavior, what options do I have to get my money back and hire someone else?   If the behavior is to be expected, it is not the end of the world but it is quite annoying.

Despite that, I was still in love with her, and wanted to try to work things out. She flat out said it wasn't going to happen, and I needed to move on. Ok, understood.  I told her I couldn't see or talk to her for a while so I could have the opportunity to move on and get over her. We didn't speak or see eachother for almost three months. In those months, i was unable to move on. No one could get even close to making me feel the same. I didn't find anyone as attractive, or as interesting. I turned down many dates and hookups. She, however, moved on.   On Easter, I decided to send her a text, which turned into plans to meet up. We ended up hooking up, and spent a solid week together. I felt whole again, and it was like she never left. She wavered quite a bit between getting back together and not trusting it and wanting to just be friends. Now, she just wants to be friends, but when we tried to hand out in that context, it turned into hooking up and her staying over again.  Is it wrong of me, knowing I can't control myself when we do see eachother, to not want to see or talk to her so I can work on moving on and getting over her? To cut her out again? I still love her, and want to try again now that we've had time apart (we lived together for almost 9 months, which started about 2 weeks into us dating due to some shitty circumstances).

The problem with all this is she has a boyfriend. We are obviously in highschool and have a class together. So here is how she found out... A week after I found out my feelings for her, I told two of my best friends. And one day as we were going to the gym for an event one of my other friends who I have never told accidentally told her. She asked the one that knows to tell her because I teased her about the girl I like a few days earlier, big mistake... The one that had no clue pointed at her because as we hang out so much he suspected the mystery girl was her. Surprise surprise he gives away the answer without even knowing it. After the event she runs up to me all smiles and says ""I know who it is, is it true"" I am shocked because just half an hour ago I told the one that knows not to tell her. She is still smiling and continues to ask. I am shocked and don't know what to do. I have known her for over a year and can't lie. So we walk in award silence to our respective classes. After that I head off to lunch and after that she approaches me again and asks the question again I finally say ""yes its you"" she says aww and hugs me. She then goes on to tell me that we won't be awkward with each other and will continue to be best friends. I am a little sad after this because I have now been placed in the infamous friend zone. The problem with all this is yet again she has a boyfriend. I don't know him because he goes to another school. I think he is a freshman and 14. I would really love to be with her she is the most amazing person I have ever been with she is funny, energetic, athletic (plays LAX' first year), and she is Peruvian. I would just love to be able to call her mine, take her on dates, be with her, and just generally spend a good amount of my time with her.

This relationship started out like a fairy tale, fell in love pretty quickly and all that jazz, but that not the important part.  His father left him at 2yrs old and that has caused him a lot of pain and suffering.  He has abandonment issues and he way to deal has been with Weed, Alcohol and Anger.  He smokes weed every day, multiple times a day.  He drinks 6-12 beers during the week and 12-24 over the weekend, plus shoots hard liquor, I think he downed 3 quarts in a month.  He has improved the drinking in the last month thought, like down to 6 beer in 3 weeks.  He see's how unhealthy the alcohol consumption is and wants to change it.  He does realize how much he drinks and does think that needs to change long term.  He also has problems with anger.  He gets into an uncontrollable rage that does scare me at points and times.  Now he has never laid a hand on me and if he ever did I would be gone in a millisecond, trust me! Never really yelled at me either, he mostly breaks things and yells at other people. We have came to the conclusion he needs to  get some help and will be starting therapy shortly, I have decided to stay and support him through this, but I wonder what am I getting my self into and that is what I need some advice on.

Mostly, though, I'd say that you're flat wrong in that your ability to predict my behavior is probably not helped greatly by the typical background check and it only biases you, and that probably along class/racial lines--hence the NY law that more or less codifies that. My chance of having documented legal action against me is based less on my behavior and more on my circumstance.   Don't get me wrong. I can see exceptions around financial crimes for jobs handling money. I can also see exceptions around mandatory reporting of highly violent crimes, but now we're in Megan's Law territory and that's a much deeper debate.

c1dm111,f28r4,lumberjackninja,"I was in a similar situation this past July. Had been dating a girl for about six months who had plans to join the Peace Corps. She passed all the medical tests and what not. She left town to live with her folks for a couple months at the end of July; she shipped out in September. We broke up at the end of June.  I knew it had been coming since started dating because there was nothing wrong with her that could bar her from going in to the PC. Still, I'd had a crush on her for a long time and she's apparently very selective when it comes to romance, meaning she'd been single for a while. Things clicked and were going really well; it got tricky though because she made a deliberate attempt to tone things down (found this out from her about halfway through the relationship).  So things got really weird about a month before she was planning on headed back home. She started ignoring me, not inviting me to hang out. Things were complicated by the fact that my new roommates were some of her old ones; so she'd come pick them up to go somewhere and they'd have to be the ones to invite me out. That was pretty frustrating.  I ended up getting tired of it. She was never one to make plans, hated having obligations. Towards the end of the relationship I brought up how it was like pulling teeth to get her to even agree to do dinner a day in advance, and how that made me feel like her fall-back entertainment. ""I feel like the guy you hang out with when you have nothing else to do."" ""That's not true!"" ""Then why don't commit to something like dinner without a huge struggle?"" ""Well, there might be something cool going on and I wouldn't want to miss it..."" ""And you don't see how this makes me feel unappreciated?""  Eventually I took her for a drive and laid it out on the table. Said I wanted to keep things going but not like this; felt like we could fix them but it was a team effort.  She said, ""what's the point? I'm gone in two months anyways."" That one hurt. I would hope that the point would be that I provided something she needed, and was willing to put an effort in to saving it. All of these negative emotions were aggravated by the fact that she'd never been particularly expressive with regards to our relationship.  So we broke up, but she did the usual ""let's be friends."" I told her to give me some time on that one. In the end, I was actually better able to handle being around her than she was me; she just couldn't deal. I learned later that after we had broken up, she went out with her friends and was visibly upset. Maybe this sounds kinda fucked up, but it felt good to know that she actually felt a sense of loss- the worst part of the whole thing was her poker face. To know that she was upset at some point because we were no longer together meant that at some point I meant something to her. That was important to me.  After a few months we started chatting again. She keeps a blog about her PC experiences, and I comment frequently. We chat on facebook. Her friends are still my friends. When she left, apparently she was telling a mutual friend that she would be open to resuming things with me once she got back but she didn't want that expectation. I even considered remaining single until she got back so I could try and rekindle things; that thought lasted all of about 18 hours.  I ended up meeting a beautiful, funny, intelligent and well-read young woman shortly afterwards. I made a point of taking it slow because PC girl was still on my mind a lot, but things have been going great. I actually feel loved, and I know she'd make sacrifices to make me happy. Also, she's a redditor, so that improves her standing a billionfold, right?  I'm sorry. I don't know where I was going with this. The whole thing was pretty traumatic. It feels good to get my story written out somewhere. Maybe it'll help you to get an idea what you might be in for. If I were you, I'd start distancing myself. Maybe make it known that you're doing so, and see what she says; see if she cares or not.  I don't know what other advice to give. You're in a shitty position and you're just going to feel shittier because her love for you wasn't strong enough to keep her here. That's gotta sting. I'd say don't let it bother you too much, your worth as a human being is not a function solely of her feelings towards you. Start chatting up other girls; nothing serious, but just prepare yourself to get back in the game when your girl leaves.  Oh, and get some good male friends. I couldn't have gotten through my last breakup, or met my current girlfriend, had it not have been for my buddies doing what they could to brighten my spirits.  Good luck man. I hope you figure it out and that when she leaves, you'll find yourself still whole.  **tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend began the peace corps application before we started dating, decided to go through with it and left about six months after we were official. It sucked but in the end I traded up and my buddies made me feel a lot better.**",r

While I am allowed to drive (actual visual impairment is pretty minor) this makes me wonder if I should be concerned about the possibility of a false positive on a roadside test or checkpoint? (Alberta, Canada but curious generally)  I'm sure it would be thrown out when it goes to court if something like that occurred due to a documented medical condition but I can imagine it would make for a pretty shitty few days or at least evening and I have to wonder if this has ever come up.

ltcv8,ltcv8,ohhellothrowaway,"Throwaway!  I'm looking for communication advice on how to break this horrible cycle. Both 25, male and female, been together about four months. When we started dating, I told him straight up that I had to talk about things, and that we had to talk disagreements through otherwise our relationship would never work. He said that that was new to him, because ex girlfriends would rather not talk about anything at all and ignore problems, and that they would get worse. We have been talking, but it goes nowhere.   Whenever I talk about something difficult, he doesn't talk back to me as if I were an adult, he talks in a strange childlike way, in a sense saying ""I am sorry I will *insert unrealistic solution here* so that you can be happy."" (Example: He said for the following situation that he will come home from work happy, refreshed and not hungry so that he will be ready to be everything that I want, which, in words I can't even articulate, is disturbing in a manipulative way).   He gets angry and upset and thus we never get anywhere with our conversation. I use a lot of ""I feel"" statements, a lot of validation of his feelings, and a lot of ""it's not your fault/it's okays"" during conversation to try and mitigate how he feels, but instead, he ends up taking everything as a horrible personality flaw within himself and turning inward, and not talking for hours, so then I have two problems: The initial problem that never really gets changed, and the fact that my boyfriend turns into ""you made me feel like shit"" mode.   Sex is so hard for us to talk about anyway for some reason (we are both rape survivors, and his libido is WAY under mine), and so whenever I bring anything up about it, it's almost a guaranteed dead-end, so I've stopped bringing anything up (which, I know, is bad). I can't seem to get past our awkwardness at attempting to initiate sex, or explaining what I want, or anything without upsetting him. I have stopped initiating sex because he swats me away so much, and he curls up and acts as though I'm a pervert that only wants sex, but I try to explain that making love to me is the highest expression of love, and I'm normal for craving it, but that I'm respectful enough to suppress my desires and ignore it because he doesn't usually feel like doing anything, and as a rape survivor, i know exactly how that could be.  Last night, he was grouchy to me when he got off work. ""No big deal,"" I think, ""he must be tired or hungry."" I quiet down as to not agitate him, I get him food, he sits down to watch a little tv to relax til he seems back to normal (he's got diabetes), and I get on reddit til he's feeling better, then I cuddle up to him and begin talking to him normally, holding his hand, petting him a bit. There was a large bit of beautiful energy shared there, as we kissed so softly and wonderfully, and I thought that it was going to go further into making love (he clearly had a full erection), but then his body language changed and he rolled away from me and began watching television again. No problem, I roll with the punches (his libido is very fickle, he's probably tired) and I scoot away a bit and continue watching a movie. He then changes the movie to a different movie, and I try kissing him again. He pulls away. I accept (understandable, he's tired) and then I lay there til he turns the tv off and rolls over away from me to go to sleep (he usually sleeps on me). I roll over shortly after and start messaging my friend Kari (girl) on my phone, and he gets upset at me, citing that he wanted to have sex tonight, but I spent too much time on reddit (about 20 minutes, ending at 12:30-- we didn't go to bed til 2:30 mind you) and thus I effectively ruined it. I told him that I tried to kiss on him and he wasn't having it, and that It was not my fault, because he pushed me away. He gets pissed further, and goes to sleep.  I take the time now to write him a facebook message detailing what happened in my mind, my reasoning behind my behavior last night (including being on reddit for a bit while he was grouchy as to give him space, getting him food etc.) and what we can do as a couple to fix all this sex initiation mess. I was very considerate, and avoided placing blame, etc. He then writes me back when he wakes up in the middle of the night to tell me that he thinks i'll be upset if I don't get held or cuddled, or sex initiated on me. &gt; ""I'll come home super happy I'll make sure to blow out all the steam from work on the way home. I'll grab food on the way home also so I'll be good to go. I'll initiate so you don't have to worry.""  We are strained, you see.  I don't understand how it's my fault for accepting that it's not going to happen and leaving it alone because I respect his wishes without complaint, thus leading him to be angry because we didn't have sex, and then dually it's my fault again for being in any remote way horny.  and me: I feel like something is dying inside of me, honestly. It took a lot of work to get over my sexual abuse history, and now I'm starting to feel resentful and betrayed by my body again for feeling aroused. He looks at porn all the time because it ""amuses"" him, and quite frankly, I feel like he has this hidden libido he chooses not to share with me because it's too much effort, or it's awkward or something. I feel resentment.  He asked me what's wrong this morning and instead of telling him, I said ""I don't want to talk about it."" and ignored it for a while, but I can't do that for very long.  Can someone shine a light for me here?  TL;DR:  Boyfriend and I have communication problems, he wont actively talk to me like an adult, tells me one thing, and does another. Our sex life is a mess, I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, nothing gets fixed, and I'm frustrated.",r
e5r6oxn,9ejvgw,Boneyabba,"Ah I see.  Memphis is a weird place for real estate.  I, like a million other people, want to buy cheap houses so I can do whatever to make them make me money.  Almost everyone else puts up stupid signs all over sends out letters to a zillion address and generally just harasses the public until something shakes loose.  I do not like this strategy as it feels a lot like those robot phone calls and I don't like getting a bunch of unsolicited sales letters.  So I would rather find something I want and go through whatever hijinx are needed to contact the one person who has a specific thing I want.  But going through the county sites I can give to samples of it not working (but there are probably 5 or 6 ways it fails- but these are good examples).

Tracked down a name and phone number that seems associated with with that name.  Address is out of state.  Phone is not connected.   Another is a run down boarded up building that has been vacant as long as any neighbors can remember.  County says it is owned by Blah Blah Church of God Ministries.  No phone number.  There is an address.  Address is in a ghetto across town and is a boarded up house. Unlike the people with the ""I buy houses cash"" signs and stuff that are just playing for volume I am an actual person with cash that wants to buy that property.  No weird wholesaling or other business.  Most people who have run down, vacant and neglected properties that are in danger of being seized for non payment of taxes would probably welcome a check for 20-200k and the issue to just disappear.  But my ability to get ahold of these people is very bad.",l

cj4gmjl,2bcql9,Zapopa,"I don't do family law. I have handled a few divorces early on in my legal career. But I am a certified mediator for the court, mostly civil issues and employment disputes. To me a divorce is the sad ending of a partnership. if it only involves two people its only about equity in what was achieved during the marriage. In that case, maybe you have an equitable pre-nup in place. That way with a divorce the financial issues are off the table. And that makes it far easier to deal with any children. What happens, and what is clear with many of the mopes who post here is that their prime concern in the divorce is to punish the other party for whatever grievances they have had. They behave in childish and selfish ways. And because their goal is to punish they almost never believe anything the court orders is fair even if it is to the rest of us. The court steps in when childish assholes cant think and speak as adults. A judge deciding everything and rendering an order is the last step after every other voluntary avenue has failed. But when it comes to child issues a wise individual will look at the situation and decide to swallow their anger to give their child a chance at a healthy life. So if the mother has never worked outside of the home and has been the primary caregiver for the seven years of the child's life, what is in the best interests of the child? For an asshole to demand full custody and physical placement? To say the mother needs to immediately go to work? To demand the mother pay child support even if she has never had a job outside the house? (and this works if the man is at home too. This doesn't happen often but on occasion it is true). That's what an asshole thinks is fair. What is smart if the parents care for the child is to say, ok mother, you get primary physical custody, we both get joint legal custody and I get the kid on weekends and Wednesday nights. Then you pay four days of child support. And as the kids gets older you work out arrangements that work best for all the parties.  It is really not that hard. The hard part is the stubbornness. Fairness and equity is not a mathematical calculation but people who have experience in the field can almost turn it into one. I can do a labor mediation of a collective bargaining agreement pretty effectively because I have had a lot of experience. A family court judge, magistrate, or advocate can easily size up what is fair for a divorce and the children. Unfortunately establishing that to ego driven angry assholes is the hard part. And that's when people pissing away their meager assets on lawyers fighting about stupid shit. Easiest way to divorce and resolve divorce and child custody issues? Don't be an asshole. Leave the anger, ego and need to punish for a night of drinking. Listen and think of the kids not yourself. Its not rocket science its only about controlling emotions.",l

nxxgt,nxxgt,,"My 21yr old BF of approx 3 years is EXTREMELY passive and lazy. Communicating with him is OK, but quality of communication is shitty. It's a pain in the ass to plan ANYTHING with him. His attitude towards spending time together (or not) is practically indifferent. Otherwise he seems content with spending time via internet and text message only...? My bantering may sound a bit one-sided, but the typical answer to ""what do you want to do this [insert occasion/day]?"" is always ""i dunno"", ""doesn't matter"". If I don't muster up the effort to make plans with him... I *seriously* wonder if I may ever see him in real life at all?  Many of his friends and family feel the same way in regards to getting a hold of him and/or the way he communicates -- very aloof and vague, almost sparse and 1-3 worded? (eg. towards his parents, all of his friends). Being his girlfriend of approx. 3 years, I'm actually impressed that he maintains constant communication with me, but the problem arises out of the quality of his communicating.. and thus the relationship loses romantic appeal. I love him VERY much, I really do. I am not demanding for the ""honey-moon-stage"" of the relationship, because I am for the most part happy with the time we spend together (even via technology). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I am starting to realize that this may perhaps just be who he is as a person (socially lazy, passive, self-absorbed). Is there anyway I could improve this?  PS. He has a history of depression, clinical OCD, ADD, and anxiety.  TLDR; Boyfriend is extremely difficult to get a hold of and whenever someone does it is very vague and ambiguous like yes or no. SO only reaches out to loved ones when in times of need (ride, money, food). This doesn't only apply to me -- in fact he treats me fairly well in comparison to friends and parents. Can I at least improve the situation or am I fucked?",r

cfhwlfh,1y62bz,slutsguts,"you say you see eachother about once a month, well thats more than most people in long distance relationships get. the time you do spend together should be used wisely, dont just sit indoors, go outside and do something, go to dinner or cinema or anything. make your time memorable so that when you arent together you can talk about that time and remember it as a happy time and have things to talk about instead of just talking about how much you miss eachother. i assume that you skype eachother most nights, so just talk about what went on in your day and talk about things that will make you laugh, you know that you'll see eachother again soon so its not like you're spending ages apart. you love him more than anything right? so being away from him for a lengthy period of time does seem hard and i know the feeling, all you can think about all day is him and how much you want to see him, but just think about how good its going to be when you see him; and you will see him. the reason you're getting so upset is because you're thinking like you arent going to see him again. Long distance relationships are hard, but trust me in what i say, this will make you stronger than you've ever been together. im not really an expert in this but i hope it helped a little, and i hope you get to see him again soon :)",r

c9kxhp5,1cvofe,cowmandude,"First try asking for it back nicely, explaining that all this isn't working out.  Next read the contract and see if they have the ability to break it, or if it says anything about finding you equitable accommodations. If they don't have the ability to do either unilaterally, send them a letter offering to allow them to break the contract for a price. You are not asking for a refund of a non-refundable fee anymore, you are asking for compensation for a company not holding up their end of a contract. If that compensation was to be equal to the fee, that would be convenient. You may consider having a lawyer write this letter for you if you have some extra money. If you do be sure to include the lawyer fee in the sum you're asking for.  The next step would be to fill out the papers to sue them in small claims court and send them a copy of them stating that you will be submitting these to the court unless they pay you X amount by some date not to far off in the future. At this point you are declaring war, and you should stop talking about finding equitable accommodations and just go to another company. You don't want to live with a landlord that you've threatened to sue.  The next step is to actually send those papers and sue them in small claims court. The filing fee is usually fairly small and you will win. When filing   be creative with how much you're asking for. You want to ask for way more than you actually want to encourage a settlement. Is the time you're putting into this worth anything? How about the time to find another place? Could your money be invested in some high yield stocks? Think about anyway this could of affected you negatively and tack that on.   Next they would be stupid not to settle. They have clearly breached the contract or will breach it shortly. Get at the minimum money for your legal fees and any money you gave them. Consider asking for more, because this is actually a big hassle they've put you through and I know what its like to be a poor college student.  If they don't settle, take them to court and destroy them. A contract is a promise. They made you a promise and then took actions that made them unable to live up to that promise. This is EXACTLY what civil court is for. I do not see anyway that you wouldn't escape with AT LEAST legal fees and the money you asked for initially.",l

If possible (meaning if she isn't trying to murder you or still be your gf after ""the talk"".. you know if it is really the MUTUAL unhappiness that it sounds like) offer to be her roommate until she gets on her feet out west.   At least give that a shot. (Put a definite end date on the arrangement though).    This is definitely a sooner the better kind of talk.  If you can get back to being friends (which I hope was the basis for your relationship in the first place) and be supportive of one another without the relationship gf/bf pressure it might not be so bad.  But if you let it drag on in gf/bf mode it will only get messier.  You just had a lot of distance between you so now is the time to act if you want to preserve that distance emotionally.   I definitely recommend not trying to date anyone else while you have the whole roommate arrangement going though.  And be sure you agree that you will both ""try"" to make it work.

I was his first girlfriend, and he had been telling me he wanted to marry me some day since around 6 years ago. I had things with other guys before we dated but nothing very serious. He had online girls before, he said nothing like me.   Back in late July he was showing me pictures on his iPod, I flipped one past the end and a picture of some girl's boobs popped up.

Obviously she wasnt too pleased and we have been in a weird gray area ever since, we have grown back together after a while and started datingish again after sometime.

I never asked her out because of the distance between us because of university. I always come back whenever I can just to see her. Matha's mother always joked around how we're all going to have a double wedding and stay together forever. Matha knows that I'm head over heels for her and how I want to be with her. She said we'll live our lives as normal as possible until we are both ready for it. Recently I couldnt come back this winter break because my great grandfather, the oldest member of our family, was in the hospital. I traveled to Spain to be with everyone. I came back for a bit to visit everyone before the semester started, but Matha has been distant. She doesn't talk to me like she used to. She's been talking to this new guy called Eric. Fucking hate that dick. I meet him once before he even met Martha and the prick blew up in my face because I was in his way when I was trying to introduce myself with a hand shake. From what I hear from her whole family he's just an awful person. He's rude to Martha's parents and always yells at her. He doesn't give a shit about her, but she clings onto him like he's a saint. She defends him at every turn without question. The guy could kick a kitten and she would defend him. I don't know what to do. Everytime I try to talk to her she'll say I changed and I don't care about her anymore. She's the one who changed.

I don't know how to cope with these feelings in a way that isn't destructive. I know my girlfriend loves me. But what do?  I don't know how to manage these feelings.

Claims for past wages come pretty far up the list -- above the claims that former customers may have.  That should include claims for accrued vacation IF the company would have paid that out had you been terminated.  2.  You should contact your insurance company to find out about health insurance.  3.  You can hold onto the chromebook, but it's still company property.

We were originally told the pay increase would roll out in late March 2017 and retroactively start Oct. 02 2016 (beginning of fiscal year 2017). &gt; April rolled around and we got the standard government BS for the delay and the promise that we will still receive retro-pay for the locality pay effective 10/02/2016. &gt;  &gt; Two weeks ago I got a letter saying that the locality pay will finally being rolled out in pay period 20 (10/08-10/21/2017) ***but with the effective date on 12/11/2016*** due to ""statutory notification requirement"" (whatever that means). I've emailed and called our HR several times, and all I got was pretty much the same response verbatim. While I don't live in the Bay Area, the locality pay of five 80+hour paycheck is nowhere near insignificant. &gt;  &gt; What can I do? &gt;  &gt;  &gt; ^* I am a hourly, W2 employee that works full time when there's work, but are otherwise in non-pay status. I get basic health insurance, but not retirement (TSP). I also don't get tenure, student loan forgiveness, competitive status, and all the good stuff. &gt;  &gt; ^** For anyone unfamiliar with federal employees' pay structure: &gt; A good majority of federal employees are under the GS pay schedule, which has two components: base pay and locality pay. Base pay is tied in to your grade and step (kinda like rank/level and number of years in said rank/level) while locality is based on where the job is located. The locality pay can go from a whopping 38% in the Bay area, to the baseline 15% in middle-of-nowheresville that everyone gets. My position didn't have locality pay at all.     --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",l
1nn97r,1nn97r,,"I'm a 21 year old male dating a 21 year old female.  I met her at work and she made me feel alive again. We went on a trip to Austin to bar hop. I had never been to a bar and it is way out of my comfort zone, but with her it felt so right and I had a blast. Sex life is great, she is horny all the time(makes me uneasy). About a month in she gets a text from a guy saying saying hey babe. I wasn't looking through her phone, we just have a habit of looking on and joining in conversations via text. I asked her who it was and why he said babe. She said it was a guy she had talked to for a week, before we met. She told him she had a bf and didn't want to talk to him. He got mad and said that she owed him money for the plane tickets and hotel he had paid for. She told me she had previous plans with him to go to Vegas and she would cancel and pay for her own way because she was going with some girls also. I was fine with that. She hangs out with a lot of guys and I'm not a jealous sort of guy.  Later on we went to a bar with her lesbian friend and a guy friend. I went to play pool with her lesbian friend and I won. She had stayed at the bar. A random guy challenged me to play so I decided to. The lesbian went back to my gf. After playing a few games I came back and the girl had her hand on her ass and there was my gf's lipstick on her face. I was extremely upset and wanted to leave. To me that was cheating. When we got home she threw up everywhere and passed out. I was still really mad and decided to see how she texts that girl and if it meant something or she was just drunk. Instead, I found that she had been texting another guy saying she liked him and she was horny, all while drunk. The guy hadn't responded in a way that would make it seem like he was egging it on. I confronted her about it and she said he was gay and she was just stating facts. I later found out that she was lying and she said she was just drunk.  I tried to leave her but she kept begging for me to not and reassuring that it all meant nothing.   Later on, I find out that the guy that first texted her was not just some guy she used to talk to but was indeed a ex of her that she dated literally weeks before me.  One night she said she was going to go out with her mom and grandma and drink a little. I was on Instagram and decided to peak at her profile and saw a pic of her and a guy at a restaurant dated the same night she was with mom and gma. She said it was her best friend and she thought I would mad, even though I never had been mad about her hanging with friends.  Next I asked her about the Vegas trip and who she was going with. She said her ex and 3 other girls. I noticed she never mentioned any of these other friends and never talks to them. Since she doesn't have his number anymore and asked her why she doesn't talk to any of them. She said she doesn't have their numbers or anything. I asked how she would meet up with them for the trip and she said she would just find them.  Afters months of fighting about it, it was finally time for her trip. I was trying to be ok with her going with her ex, but honestly felt like shit and asked her not to go. She wouldn't cancel. I even told her I would leave her if she did and still no. I felt bad so I let her go. I just asked that she sent a ton of pics and called me. When she got there she sent me a pic of her room. She is staying by herself and there was guys dress shoes on the floor. She said her ex couldn't pack them so he asked her to carry it. I then later saw in the picture a guys wallet and a lighter(she doesn't smoke).  We fought and fought about it and I ended up breaking up with her but she kept trying. She kept acting fishy about it. I would ask her to FaceTime me and she said the wifi doesn't work here. She was at the luxar or whatever and it was hard to believe they don't have a working wifi. She started to make me act crazy and I started asking for pics of the room and bed. She would take forever to take them or just happen to fall asleep when I asked. She would sent pics of the room in the worst angles and light. I kept asking for more or I wouldn't get back with her. Finally she did and I could see someone in the bed. So it turns out she didn't go with an ex and girls it was her ex, some guy and his gf. She said that guy was just sleeping in her bed because his gf fucked her ex and he was upset. I asked her for the receipt of the room and it said for 2 adults, but she could never really explain it.   Right now she is back and I'm not with her but we act like it. She is trying to prove herself and stop lying. She has a lot of ex and dad issues in her past. This isn't all the lies but the highlights. As of now, I haven't noticed anything. I just don't know if I should be forgiving or leave her. Look at the way I acted, reading her texts, asking for pics, etc.  she wrote me a long letter saying how she knows she fucked up but she loves me and needs me. It also said that she isn't lying anymore or hiding anything, but she has said that too many times.  I love this girl, I really do but I feel like she is causing more pain than happiness. I had quit smoking before I met her and been off it for months. I now smoke 2 packs a day.  What do?:/  Sorry for bad English and no tl;dr.",r

nvygd,nvygd,throwaway_112,"""S"" and I started dating sometime before the summer. We had mutual friends, but started getting to know each other more even though she moved back to her home town, which is about 100 miles from where I currently live. My plan was to move up there as well, since most of my friends moved there, and I was waiting on the opportunity to gather enough funds to make my move.  We were both madly in love, even though the long distance relationship was hard to deal with on her part. We would take turns visiting each other about twice a month, and at times I would stay with her longer than a week.  Fast forward to last week - I've never celebrated Christmas, let alone bought presents for anyone before. (Moved here from another country when I was 11). I met her parents, who even invited to go with them on their vacation right at the end of summer, and seemed to like me. I purchased presents for them and helped decorate their Christmas tree right around the end of November. As soon as I got up there on the 23rd, we sat down in her room and she starts breaking down crying. She tells me that the long distance is hard for her, and I should consider getting back together with her once I've moved up there. What's truly difficult is the fact that my birthday is on the 31st, and I was really looking forward to having a girlfriend that I could have a new years eve kiss with. We had made plans to go to the beach, and the timing of the breakup is what hurts the most. If she truly loved me, she wouldn't have done that right before the holidays.  ****TL;DR Girlfriend broke up right before Christmas and my birthday, and now I need to know what I should do.

All you guys said is that you felt something  (right? or am I wrong?), but if you never made a move on it (dating exclusively?) then she did nothing wrong.   It's weird because I date multiple guys at a time until we have the ""exclusivity"" talk. I may have chemistry with one person more than another, but I wont sit around and wait for him to decide if I'm important enough. There's plenty of fish in the sea and I've been burned before by someone who showed tons of interest, but wasn't willing to throw in some level of commitment; even if it's just dating exclusively.  On the flip side of that, with a guy I've been on dates with I would never, ever do something like this in front of him. However, if we've never even dated and all he said was, ""I think I have feelings for you..."" but never acted on it, I mean, I'm not really the type of person to climb all over a guy in front of other people, but if I didn't feel like it was going to go anywhere and we ran in the same circle of friends I don't know if I would feel bad about flirting with other guys.  I don't know, I would just say-- that if she is the type of person who would use a situation like this to prompt a reaction out of you, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with her because the adult thing to do is talk about it and establish things, but if this was never done-- I don't know if you can entirely fault just her for it.",r

c1hfunn,foha3,brand_new_throwaway,"We're both Australian, and we've been dating since 2007. She'd lived in London before, so she couldn't come back. I wanted to move there. So, after a discussion about how we could move to London - and establishing the only way was if we got married - we decided to get married. Beforehand we covered the basis - separate finances, and if we decide we don't like each other, we just separate and remain friends (her idea) to the end of five years. We were totally open about the whole thing to her parents, my parents, and everyone else in Australia. We had a quick wedding, originally just us and a couple of friends, but we decided to let her elderly grandparents (then her and my parents along) at the last minute.  In 2008 we moved. The first week she was here someone asked about our recent wedding and I mentioned the visa thing. She baulked, and got angry - I think she felt less valued because of it, so I stopped mentioning it. The standard answer to 'how did we propose' has changed from 'we were walking back from a movie and decided to live in London' to 'we were walking back from a movie and decided to get married because of how very deeply in love with her'. NONE of her old friends know about the visa thing, with perhaps one exception.  Fast forward to 2011. I don't find her attractive anymore. She's put on a lot of weight, stopped dressing nicely, and has a few somewhat gross habits. I have to spend all my weekend time with her, and I can't work on my personal projects when she's in the room as I'm obligated to talk to her. She asks me if I love her all the time, but in such a way as if she's going to get angry if I say I don't. She has, in her head, the idea that we're married and about to have kids. For me, the relationship isn't anywhere near as serious and stable as that.   She's a nice person, but I'm simply not in love with her anymore. But we live together. There's nothing more I'd like than to be free again. And I think it would be better for her to be with someone who appreciates and loves her more than I do.  But I know as soon as I say something, her world will come crashing down. She's a self harmer, and would go absolutely nuts if she knew how I really feel.  TLDR: Help. I'm trapped.",r
djjiri7,6k4tz4,Gumstead,"If the IL Secretary of State becomes aware of any underage alcohol-related offense committed as a minor, you will have license suspended. This an administrative process, not a criminal process. Its similar to having your license suspended for refusing to submit to DUI testing. It is irrelevant if the alcohol offense is related to driving, you simply have to be convicted of an age-based offense.  Based on that other linked thread, you have a few options. You can choose to gamble your license on whether or not they have a case against you. My guess is that you're guilty, otherwise you wouldn't be worried about this at all. So, you can hope they have nothing and ignore it, the trade-off being that if you're wrong, you will lose you license for a while.   Your other option is to take their offer of a local ordinance ticket and basically take a hit to save your license. You can certainly show up and talk with them, showing up is not a presumption of guilt and no reputable judge would convict you solely for showing up to entertain their offer. I had a similar situation and I was offered a larger fine to have the charge amended to an open alcohol in public (not age related) and got to keep my license.  One thing to note is that the license suspension is not up to the judge or police, it is from the Secretary of State and the only way to reverse it is to request a suspension hearing. It's really up to you, the only way to negotiate the charges and such is to basically admit to it and work out a plea, which is why I say you basically are gambling your license on the strength of their case.",l

She can't get over my sexual history. She was a virgin when we met, though her previous long term, long distance relationship brought her as close as possible to sex without actually going through with it. We have a great sex life, but she can't get over the number of partners I've had. How many? only around 6/7. And the majority of them were over the course of a year, one year before we met. Nothing crazy, I've never cheated on anyone, in fact my past isn't that bad. but she thinks I'm a womanizer and that I'm going to cheat on her. I'm the most devoted boyfriend ever but she just can't get it through her head that I'm all hers. What do? I want her to takl to a counselor but she won't.

I will not typically care how mad or upset you get should it happen, after all you ask for it yourself, and if it comes to ""respecting the relationship"", you already disrespected it by doing it first.  The point that you asked does make it fair game.

c2x04ca,m00t5,karmasutur3,"&gt;I didn't see this coming.  Unless you are in a horrible relationship, whether the idea was good or bad, it's not going to feel good in the breakup phase. Did you not know this going in? I'm sorry. (really). Now you do. Next time you can plan appropriately.   &gt;But I was continually feeling more and more distant from her. I was having all these fun times with my friends and she wasn't there for them. I started to have doubts about whether the relationship was sustainable. A few petty fights later and I say that I want to take more responsibility at work and school and take charge of my life and not have to be weighed down by such a distant relationship.  It actually sounds like you made the right call.   &gt;Little did I know that I would feel worse now than then.   Ok, now this comment freaks me out a little bit. I have a question for you: Why do you think your feelings suddenly switched? If you are unhappy, that would be the reaction I would expect from the breakup process. And also, it seems like you have some possible misconceptions about yourself and your emotional states.   &gt;I called to see how she was doing today  Why the hell would you do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, i've got this nice wound here, also she has a wound, so lets rub salt and chilis in both of them!  Are you kidding me? You broke up with her and you're calling her? Not only is that insane for you, it's being a huge dick to her. Stop it.   &gt;Now she's saying that she doesn't want to just run back to me because I changed my mind... I actually think pretty highly of her for standing her ground... but now I just don't know what to do.  Stop being an ass? Look, even if you weren't making yourself look really, really bad right now, when you get her back, it's going to go something like this:  You're going to be stoked for a while, things will go great, but then sooner or later, one of the two of you (probably you) is going to end up right back at the place you started, bored and wanting out. So you'll just repeat this cycle again.   &gt;Halp.  You actually want halp? Call her , apologize for breaking up with her then changing your mind immediately, tell her she won't be hearing from you, apologize again, then hang up, delete her number and block her facebook, and go about your life. If you haven't already done permanent damage and things end up right, I'm sure she'll find a way to find you and let you know. Otherwise, move on.   &gt;Am I just going through withdrawals from being in a loving relationship  Yup. and you are dragging a girl through the mud while you do it. This is what most people refer to as 'being an huge asshole'. You're giving guys a bad name.   &gt;Should I keep pursuing her until I get her back?   If you were in love with someone, and she broke up with you callously, over distance, and then changed her mind in a week, what would you think of her? NO. Drop it, for your and her sake.

n3k95,n3k95,,"22f here dating a 22m, both in college, for about 3 months. Everything is great, except for this problem. It's his first serious relationship and I've done my best to be as understanding as I can be about his inexperience.  Physical affection is not a problem (Although he doesn't like PDA, that's another can of worms).  For example, I cook all the time. I am constantly making him meals or surprising him with cupcakes, cookies, pies, pastries and the like, just because I care about him.  I've also started planning making a gift basket of all his favorite things for Christmas. I asked him if he had any Christmas gifts in mind that he'd like, and he said he'd get back to me. I have this sneaking suspicion I'll get him a gift and receive nothing in return. For others who enjoy spoiling their SOs with gifts, attention, little notes and ""reminders"" of how important they are, I'm sure you can understand how it kind of sucks when it's not reciprocated slightly. I don't want a lavish gift. I don't want him to spend a ton of money. I just want to know he's thinking of me as much as I think of him, that's all.  The second way he won't show affection is verbally. I constantly tell him he's handsome, gorgeous and brilliant. One morning I sent him a text listing my favorite quirks of his, just in an attempt to brighten his day. I have NEVER received any similar affection. He has never complimented me in the entire time we've been dating. Except for once, when he was drunk, and said I had ""awesome tits"".  It's not about needing him to compliment me so I'll feel beautiful. My self confidence is not an issue. It just sucks when you're making love to someone, look up and say ""You're so handsome right now."" and he just stares...  I know the first advice I'll get is to talk to him. Well, I have. Multiple times. And he's always said he'll think about it more, yet here I am tonight texting him about how there's something about him I like so much, and his reply is ""mmk.""  Is this total relationship noob behavior or is he just being a dick? Because otherwise, we have great conversations and he says he's totally committed to me.  edit; typo.   edit2; also, there have been a few times where's he's said something like ""I like you."" or something basic, and my first instinct is to say, ""Oh, did it kill you to say that?"" or something bitchy, I'm so afraid I'm becoming resentful and I'm just going to drive him away...",r
3ihm96,3ihm96,brrraaap,"Hey everyone,  I'm hoping for some advice regarding a situation I'm currently in. My roommate and I have not been getting along for quite some time(understatement), so I emailed the landlord stating my intent to sublet my half of the lease, which is allowed per the lease. I have 8 months remaining and can't handle living with him for that much longer.  The roommate got a copy of this email and proceeded to lose his shit, even though we are both in agreement that we no longer want to live together.  Since then, he is making it difficult if not impossible for me to sublet the room. He is uncooperative with me, and with the landlord he acts like I'm trying to screw him over. The landlord understandably wants nothing to do with the situation and won't even return my calls.  I have tried asking him to meet at a neutral place for coffee to talk it out and be able to proceed, but won't agree to that either.  In the emails I have sent him, I have repeatedly said that I just want to get this settled legally (not break my lease) and move on, but again he is intentionally dragging it out.  I have a very limited budget and see no way to hire a lawyer. Even if I could, I don't know if there is anything they could do to solve the issue.  I have spoken with a mediator, but that route won't work since the roommate refuses to do anything proactive to allow us to go our separate ways.  I have never dealt with someone so childish in my entire life, and am at a loss for what to do.  Any advice?   Edit: I live in Austin, Texas.",l

c2h5lsc,jvmr3,throwaway302,"I was in the friend zone once. I was friends with this girl for about 7 months before making a move. When I did I could tell she was a little uncomfortable, but she made out with me a little. The next day she was ignoring that there was any romantic chemistry between us. We continued to be friends for another two months and I had given up hope of being anything more. Out of the blue one day she asked me out, and we've been going strong for a few months now.   I'm sorry I don't have any secret on how to get out of the friend zone. In my case I just don't think she was ready or felt the same way at the time I did.

m4z0u,m4z0u,IdleBlood,"We've been together almost 3 years now, we're both 25.  She's everything I want in a future wife.  She's smart, beautiful, successful, driven, and we both want the same thing out of our future.  It's very clear that we both feel this way deep down inside because neither of us is willing to let go of this relationship, despite the fact that the actual relationship has decayed to a point where neither of us is happy.  We have two main issues that have been persistent for most of the relationship and are pretty much the only thing we haven't been able to work through.  The first is that we both have very different needs in terms of spending time together.  I'm a very introverted person, and I like a lot of ""me"" time.  She's the opposite.  She HATES being alone, and always wants to spending time with me whenever possible.  It seems like we can never come to terms on this.  The problem is that when she's not getting the attention she desires, then she can turn very bitter.  Of course, this only exacerbates the issue since I only want to further distance myself from her.  Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with her more than any other person in the world.  We have amazing, deep conversations.  The issue is simply that the amount of ""me time"" I want and the amount of ""us time"" she wants seem to drastically overlap.  We're both pretty subborn people so it seems impossible to reach a mutual agreement here.  The other issue is that she has some trust issues.  Nothing too terrible, she doesn't read my e-mails or spy on me or anything like that.  What will happen is that if she notices something out of place (me not getting home at the exact time I usually do, me taking a nap when I normally wouldn't, etc) then she'll start with a huge line of questioning trying to figure out ""what I'm hiding"".  The reason for this is obvious, since her last boyfriend cheated on her.  Her father also left her mother when she was about 12, so I think that might have some cause for this as well.  However, I've been completely faithful to her our entire relationship, and have never cheated on any girl I've ever been with.  She knows she has these issues, since these fights always go the same way.  She gets more and more pissed and accuses me more and more, things get extremely heated, and then eventually she breaks down and realizes that she's not being fair to me.  These two issues are the main source of our unhappiness, but it's completely detrimental.  Our fights get so heated that we're both left damaged afterward (screaming at each other, insulting each other, sometimes even shoving each other or throwing things).  We both understand how detrimental this is, but in the heat of the argument there's always one person who refuses to back down, even when the other attempts to diffuse this situation.  I feel like I'm usually the one who tries to diffuse it (usually by walking away), but admittedly I've been guilty of escalating it too.  Now it's to the point where it doesn't seem like either person has any respect for the other.  Things just keep getting worse, and we keep digging ourselves deeper.  It seems like everything is beyond repair, and we've both said out loud that we think we're too lethal to each other for this to work.  The only thing that's keeping us together is that we love who the other person is deep down inside, and neither of us think we'll find someone else we'll love as much.  We don't have the money to pay for any sort of relationship counceling, but we don't know what else to do.  Can a promising relationship become so decayed that it's beyond revival?  Should we just let this relationship die so that we can go our separate ways and try to be happy again?",r
9qplsv,9qplsv,hamilton24601,"I moved out of my apartment near the end of June. The landlord never sent the security deposit to either my roommate or myself. After 21 days (legal time to return or provide reasons for withholding), I contacted him by text, email, and sent a demands letter. He responded to the email saying it should have been sent by his office and he would look into it. He also said he was out of the country.   Another few weeks went by and I followed up and didn't hear anything. I told him I was planning to file in small claims court. Finally, he replied to my email saying that he was still out of the country (I don't believe it) and that the deposit was being withheld because I had not paid two months of rent. I forwarded him emails he had sent me from the time period he said I had not paid where he said he had found my checks and we were all good. Now, he says it was actually someone else's rent check he found that happened to be for the same amount as mine. I looked through my records and those two checks actually hadn't been cashed. I offered to pay him the difference between my deposit and the amount of rent he hadn't cashed as long as he paid my roommate their deposit. He never replied.  Now, my roommate wants their money back and is contacting him again. Am I still liable for the rent amount even though I have emails documenting that he said I had paid?

Nothing I do is right, she tried lying to me to break up with me saying her mom never wants me over again. I confronted her about it but she said she just needs space. I've been giving her that. I would do anything in the world for her, she means so much to me.   Yesterday I was admitted to a local hospital because my mom found me jaundiced and vomiting blood. I spent the entire day there and night. Getting tests done etc. turns out they think I might have drug induced hepatoxicity from a treatment I got last week for heavy metal poisoning. They told me my liver was failing and they don't know why. I might only have two weeks left on this planet they told me. Transplant is not an option because they do not want to put a healthy liver into a sick body they're unsure what is making it sick. I got discharged this morning to go to a further away hospital which is covered by our insurance.   I told my girlfriend this. It's her birthday today. I haven't told her the I might be dying part of things. She apparently called the hospital and they didn't have my discharge on record and said I wasn't there. I texted her earlier and she said she is furious with me that I would lie to her. I asked why and she explained that to me. I sent her a picture of my hospital ID bracelet, the fresh IV wound and band aid with gauze and my blood on it. Bewildered. How do I prove this to someone who wants to believe it's a lie?

164s98,164s98,throwafar1,We've been together for four years and been through a lot together but lately things just haven't been the same before was a forbidden relationship because his parents didnt except me every time we had together was passionate now that he is a new job and he's moved out it feels like the passion has gone and we spent so much time together that it's almost as if were annoyed with each other I wanted to love back I don't know how to get it back he spends a lot of time by himself and Soda why he seems to resent me because he quit the basketball team four years ago because of our relationship however I refuse to take responsibility for that because that was his decision and I didn't want to at the time ever since then he's gotten out of shape and he resents me for will be having fun and then she will randomly be like I need alone time are you sensuous time here and then I'll get pissed off and I'll leave then he'll call me up the next day want me back is getting really frustrating because when he moved out When he moved out he had all these plans for a life together he wanted to get married he wanted us to sleep together you wanted us to wake up together and get ready for work and you know he wanted to buy me a card she wanted us to build this beautiful house you wanted us to get engaged soon I know that this is all coming closer it seems that all he wants is to be away from me and he lost time for the future but then when the future comes he gets scared and then I'm getting nervous because I all my eggs are in one basket with him. I love them to death but I know this rebellion has to do with how strictest parents were on him and he feels he went from history parents to no being for bed and are now being strict relationship with me but in reality I'm actually pretty easy-going and I think a lot of his resentments he's taking out from his parents on me I told him This and we talk about it nothing seems to solve it and I don't know what to do. I know ultimately he wants to marry me I know ultimately he loves me I know ultimately his goals for the future are with me but it's extremely frustrating when I thought we are working toward something together and all the sudden he's pulling back. He used to get threatened by my friends so I stopped hanging out with them. when he wanted to go to the gym I would resent him because I would say what you made me stop hanging with my friends you can't ditch me so became very unhealthy. now that things are healthy now he doesn't mind if I hang with my friends I don't mind if he goes the gym but yet we still have these resentments toward each other and things are just going downward spiral he's gaining weight he's not working out I'm trying to get him to work out and I'm miserable focus too much on the relationship yet I still dont go out with friends.   I know he loves me and he wants to marry me and I love him with all my heart but I feel like he's falling out of love with me. I miss the old him the one that would try and make me happy the one that had a spark for life,r

40ckkj,40ckkj,Kadams1611,So today I was driving on the highway which is 55. Which is super slow for the highway and nobody goes that slow. I am in Illinois BTW. There was light traffic and I didnt even notice I was going 75. Which did not feel that fast to me but it is 20 over. I got pulled over clocked at 75. When asked to see insurance I only had 2 cards that expired 10 days ago. The insurance company sent me the wrong amount so they had to resend me insurance cards and I never put them back into my wallet. So he comes back and gives me two tickets. One for no insurance and one for 75 In 55. Both tickets have a court date in a month and a half and he took my license. I am about to turn 21 and have never been pulled over since I started driving at 16. He said to just bring papers that show o have insurance and it will be thrown out. What can I do about the speeding ticket? Thanks so much!,l

5wk41v,5wk41v,dsm1217,"My family and I moved right outside of Colorado Springs last summer. When we rented the leasing agent did not disclose any HOA was in place. We were here a month or so before the other people living in the townhome complex mentioned it.   Recently we have been getting notices that our 12-year-old daughter can't ride her bike per HOA rules anywhere other than the ""playground"", a 24 x24 rock and concrete area with one shitty splintering wooden swing set in it. This playground has zero space for kids to run and play, much less ride a bike. Apparently the HOA rules state kids can only play in the playground area, i know this because the jerk who works for the HOA accosted my daughter while she was riding her bike rather than come notify me.   My daughter isn't of the age where she wants to be on a playground with toddlers and i certainly would not have rented here had i been told my daughter wouldn't be allowed to ride her bike on the property.   Is not disclosing this fact a violation of Colorado rental laws? i'd like to get out of the lease and move somewhere that my daughter can play without a bunch of whiny old people turning her in every day. The lease would be up in August. it probably doesn't matter, but their is at least one other family who rents here who was also not told of the HOA and rules regarding kids playing. Each unit is owned by a different owner, it's not like an apartment complex. The other family rents from a different management company.",l

866doh,866doh,Blorkershnell,"Hi everybody, and thank you in advance for any help. Last year I began receiving emails regarding my Amazon seller account saying they were having problems transferring funds to my bank and other emails with customer complaints saying they never received their products. I had not used my Amazon seller account in about 3 years, at which time I was just selling textbooks. All of the items in question now seemed to be big ticket things like computer parts and camera equipment. At some point in this process I was also charged about $6,000 on my credit card due to this issue (thanks Chase Bank for fixing that problem quickly and replacing my card).  I called Amazon in April 2017 to report my account had been hacked and that it needed to be closed. They gave me a ticket number and said their fraud department would investigate and get back to me. Their fraud department calls a day later and assists me in resetting my password but says they can’t close my seller account because there is an outstanding balance... duh, that’s the laundered/stolen funds. It’s why I’m calling.   Cut to May 2017 and they still haven’t been able to close my account and the pending funds are sitting somewhere around $33,000, which of course is spiraling me into an “oh god I’m gonna have to live in a cardboard box how am I gonna feed my cats” panic. I file another report, same answer. They eventually freeze my account and the problem seems to have been resolved.   Cut to today when I get an email eerily similar to last year. I log in and lo and behold the same issue has started up again (image in a link below for one day’s worth of statements). I call and am given the same information as last year and am also told that their “VCAC” department that handles fraud does not have a direct phone number and that the customer service reps can not connect to them directly, all they can do is submit my grievance and I wait for VCAC to call me. Again. The next funds transfer from my seller account to this mysterious bank account is scheduled for Friday this week.   So, good people of r/legaladvice: this smells like thievery and/or money laundering to me, especially as some of the bank transfers have been in dollars and some in Euros (I’m in the US). Amazon is not helping so should I file a police report? If so is there a particular way to go about this to make it productive? I have copies saved of all the fraudulent statements.

gx4ls,gx4ls,geoffmandoo,"Hey reddit.  Im kinda hurting right now.  I guess it started off several months ago when my girlfriend of 4ish years broke up.  After a couple months we started talking again and having sex again.  This is actually so embarassing for me for some reason.  I think I have a problem addmiting that I have a problem and Im pretty sure I think that because I dont want to burden other people with more issues.  Everyone has a lot going on in their life and I just think for me to add one more thing to that pile is selfish... yeah i guess that is the word.  Well, she had a guy she was talking to while we were hooking up again but he was out of town for a while.  Spend time together, hook up, etc for a few months.  Well, we hung out a few nights ago and we come back to my place and end up having sex.  As shes leaving she tells me that she slept with the other guy a few nights before.  It really hurt me. I know we werent together and I honestly expected this to happen, I knew it would.  But I have a serious self consious problem.  I couldnt help but ask her how it was (she said it was just sex), if he was better than me (she said ""honestly, you're a better fuck"") and if he was bigger than me (she said she didnt compare).  My problem is that i see those answers as ""God, you dont want to know the answer, take this ""truth"" and go inside and dont think about it anymore"".   She wants to still be friends, i dont know, she might even still want to hook up.  I just dont know what to do.  Our relationship had problems like anyone else, and I think it got to a point where it was hard to resolve the problems because we had too many expectations of each other maybe, I dont know.  But I loved her more than anything I've ever cared about in my life.  Just being around her made me very happy, we could do anything and it was fine so long as I was with her.  I'd go shopping with her (Huh?) because i knew she liked shopping and liked being with me so it was a win-win for everyone.  I also dont know what to do about ""being friends"".  Im not going to sit by and play 2nd chair boyfriend.  I thought this was going to be my wife and I have to think about another man fucking her?  But, I also love her still and would miss her terribly if we didnt speak.   Im already indesisive enough, but I really thought that one day we would get married.  Its been four or so years since Ive talked to other girls, so not only do I have no idea how to, but I also have the burden of crippling self doubt.  For example, even if a girl and I make eye contact or anything like that (I honestly have no idea how people even flirt its been so long since ive considered it), its automatic for me to think shes not interested, has  a boyfriend, or ""she doesnt think Im attractive"" or something to this effect.   So I was at the local bar last night and I think the bartender is absolutly beautiful.  We're friends I guess, maybe slightly more than aquanitences.  We've hung out in groups, drank, bullshitted.  But after I was done eating, I purposely didnt drink, I filled out my check and decided I had to write her something explaining what I thought of her.  We arent going to get together or anything over this, shes got a history with a friend of mine and he told me recently that he was still interested in her so Im would even pursue it anyways.  So I wrote her a note, about 15 sentances long, explaining that Im in a tough place right now and that Im kinda bummed out.  I told her I didnt want to be a creep or anything but that I thought I had to say something because I dont feel like I can talk to members of the opposite sex.  I said that I think she is beautiful and that it makes me feel better to see her every few days, that she has a wonderful smile and that I hope she doesnt ever get too down on herself because she is a great person.  The intent of the letter was two fold.  1.  I thought i needed to just ""jump"" and get over my fear of talking to women.  2.  I thought that if I could make her feel a bit better and put a smile on her face with some kind words, it would make me feel better.  We talked, I explained to her that I wrote something to make me feel better and gave it to her.   I know if these things go on too long, people wont read them.

Location: Missouri   TL;DR question is if someone is threatening to sue after a car accident with the agenda to remove someone else's driver license likely a scare tactic to get someone to fork over money or is it an actual thing she can do?   So the case is this, my best friend was driving her boyfriend to work with his car. (He had asked her to so he could eat on the way) She admits to tailgating on an entrance ramp onto a highway. The other car attempted to merge but there was a truck that wouldn't let them, so they swerved back onto the ramp and slammed on the brakes. My friend rear ends them. No one was seriously injured but I think both cars were totaled or in bad shape.   The police put the blame of the accident on her because she was driving too close.   She finds out while they're sorting everything out that her boyfriend didn't insure his car(his reasoning was that he didn't think he would ever get into an accident 😒) This causes some stress in the situation but ultimately the fee for driving without insurance was waived by a judge because my friend is insured.    The mom of the other driver has been the one doing all the communication with my friend. Which is a red flag to me because the driver has a kid of her own. From what it sounds like she wants my friend to pay outside the court.  I thought everything was settled when the judge waived the insured fee but apparently the mom is still texting my friend, saying if she doesn't pay she's going to take them to court. At first she was saying that she could get my friend's license removed and now it both my friend and my friend's boyfriend.   All I see are red flags. I've never been in an accident but I thought the only case that you could lose your license was if you did something bad enough to get arrested and the courts took your license based on your crime. I really doubt you could sue someone to have their license taken.   I told my friend to save her texts because if she's threatening her frequently enough it could be a form of harassment.   But again, Idk. I can tell my friend is worried and I don't want to give her bad advice.",l

Does he seriously prefer their *friendship* over our *relationship*?  **EDIT:** he was with her last night, and i have a very strong feeling hes with her again tonight. Because i purposely avoided hanging out with him tonight, to prove some kind of fucked up point and/or make him jealous, thinking im out having fun without him.",r

mf9lf,mf9lf,throwitallawayornot,"Been with this girl for around 2 years. In love with her. My best friend, who I've known since I was maybe 15 (27 now) lives in NY and we visit back and forth pretty regularly. He came to visit me last week or so, everything seemed kosher. This morning, I noticed my GF's diary, which she has never written in had fallen off the shelf. I noticed there was a lot of writing in it which was odd since she has had it and not touched it for months. Here is where things get interesting.    It read:   ""I had a dream about kissing XXXX. It was a cute passionate kiss. And I can't stop thinking about it. I know eventually I will. Dreams always seem to effect me weird. Whenever I have a dream about throwitallawayornot cheating or something I am usually mad at him for a couple of days even if he didn't do anything.    Anyways, XXXX is always showing he has a little something for me. It bothers everyone but no one will say anything. He has tried to kiss me, he is always touching me and it has been weird. But this trip, it was almost like I was looking for it, wanting it. I would walk past him and touch his shoulder. Or hand him something and hold onto his hand an extra second. Like I was egging him on. Daring him to do something about it. What the fuck.   The entire time I was taking this attention and almost using it against throwitallawayornot. Like throwitallawayornot isn't soft like that with me. He isn't cute. He isn't romantic. And that's not what I was seeing when  I was seeing xxxx. The other night I was wanting throwitallawayornot to leave the room so I could lock eyes with him more.    And I know he wants it too. That's what is hard as well because I know I am messing with his head when I am doing these things to him. I am only making things more difficult for their relationship, our relationship and my relationship with throwitallawayornot. It is also trying on my relationship with (xxxx's sister) because she gets upset that I am even talking to him at all besides when he is visiting. I have pretty much learned not to tell her anything anymore about it.    He and I were talking online about things and I mentioned one thing about throwitallawayornot and he flips and stops talking to me. That is weird.   The truth is that if I wasn't completely, totally, utterly in love with throwitallawayornot, I would probably be interested in him. He is smart, he has a cool job, his family is great, I love his sense of style and he has a huge birthmark that actually kind of turns me on. So overall, he is an amazing guy, he deserves a rad chick that can care about him as much as he will care about her. but that is not me. throwitallawayornot is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time and I am not willing to let that go. He really is my other half.    At other times I almost fantasize about just escaping burlington and going to NY on a whim, cheesy movie type escaping where I go there in the pouring rain, get to his door soaking wet, crying because I can't believe I actually did it. I knock on the door and he opens it and takes me in his arms. We have that perfect kiss again... and again... and again... I lock him into his room and have him to myself for hours. He hasn't been with that many people so I know I would be taking control and that turns me on just thinking about it.    But then its all over and I know I would always end up back with throwitallawayornot. He is the love of my life.""   So there you have it. After talking to her, she just tried to convince me that the entire thing was just writing down a series of her dreams that she had over the few days he was here last week and none of it had any bearing on reality.

dvnsmed,848ubb,Eeech,"Sending you to collections will hirt yoir credit score, bit thats about it. If they are required to allow you to repay the overage along with the other amount is spelled out in your loan documents, but it's probably not.    More importantly, having it sent to collections isn't going to hurt you significantly more than being in your current position. We do not have debtors prisons in this country, and not being able to pay your bills is not a crime. So you're safe there. Being in collections just means another party is going to be trying to collect it.    You can set up a payment plan with them. If you're unable to reach an agreement, they can sue you. This also isn't the end of the world, and not a whole lot changes. They will be awarded a legal judgement, but that doesn't make you have to magically come up with money you don't have. A judgement will allow them to seize money in bank accounts, but only if there is money to seize. They can also potentially garnish your wages, but they can't take all of your check. Minimum wage is not usually enough to be garnishes at all, and only a portion of your wages can be taken no matter how much you earn.    Ultimately, you will need to repay it. Student loans can not usually be discharged in bankruptcy. But at no point will anyone have the legal power to *make* you pay money you simply don't have.    I advise you to post in r/personalfinance to educate yourself on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and your rights. They are also extremely helpful helping people who are in a tough financial position learn ways to better manage their finances to repay debts and regain better footing.    Again, being in debt isn't the end of the world. It is difficult and unpleasant, but it can be overcome with enough patience and hard work. Learn your rights under FDCPA, keep trying to secure better employment and keep pushing through. Don't stress yourself out over having the debt sent to collections. I promise, it really will be okay.",l

My Dad is kind of a neglectful person in some respects. He has a problem of sometimes leaving his car unlocked and he sometimes forgets his wallet in the car. Well the one night he happens to do both, his wallet gets stolen. Now granted this isn't too crazy on its own since we have been having problems with people stealing from cars around our neighborhood so we just assumed they got lucky that particular night. The truly baffling part was that they managed to take $1000 out of one of their bank's ATM's because they knew his PIN number. I just found out today that the fraud department found during their investigation that whoever did this managed to get the PIN number correct on the first try which is why they were able to take all of that money out without an issue. The police are baffled and are telling them that they have never seen a case like this, and the fraud department suspects that it wasn't even theft but an inside job to try and scam them out of money. My parents are honest people so I know they have nothing to do with it themselves, and the only clue I have as to how someone could have guessed the PIN(which is now changed) was that it was the last 4 digits of my mom's SSN. The thing is nothing in his wallet could've given that information, neither of my parents readily hand out info like that because they are paranoid people, and the fact they got it right on the first try means it couldn't have been one of many guesses as far as I can tell. I'm just wondering how this is possible and what type of recourse they should take at this point.",l

qqu2j,qqu2j,cojoco,"I'm not a poster in this sub, but I came here because I've had a series of conversations in the last few days which I find deeply troubling.  I'm not here to ask advice, but perhaps to dispense it.  I've been with only one partner in my life, and we've been together for more than 25 years, so although my views might come across as old-fashioned, I hope that you'll at least think about what I have to say.  Here's a summary of a conversation I've had three times in the last few days with different people, including my daughter:  ---  **Me:**  I think courting is very important.  It takes a while for people to open up, and a relationship is hugely risky, as falling in love is a big commitment.  **You:** That is so old-fashioned.  It's all sluts and studs now.  **Me:** So you're a slut/stud then?  **You:** Oh no.  I'm actually living like a puritan.  ---  Maybe it's just a coincidence that I've been confronted by the same idea several times in the last few days, but I find it deeply worrying.  I think that popular culture has ingrained the idea that two people can just meet and hop straight into bed with each other, and then have a relationship develop later in its own good time. If that describes you, then that's wonderful, you don't need to read any further.  However, I believe that for a huge number of people, perhaps even the majority, getting into a relationship takes time, and may take months, or even years.  At the same time, many of the same people believe that if a relationship doesn't lead to sex within a month or so, then one of the parties is being used, or strung along.  One of the people I was talking to about this even believes that to continue in such a relationship is evidence of low self-esteem.  I think that they could not be more wrong about this.  To pursue a relationship in the absence of sex does not show that one has low self-esteem, but *high* self-esteem.  One can only court a partner if one believes themselves to be a prize worth winning, which requires *high self-esteem*.  I just want people to recognise that if two people are building a relationship, then falling in love is a lot more important than having sex.  If they're really into each other, then sex will come eventually, and is worth waiting for.  What are your thoughts about this?  I'd like to know. If you think I'm an idiot, or wrong, or misguided, or dangerous, then please tell me, as this is important to me too.  EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that courtship is for everyone, and I certainly don't mean to imply that there's anything wrong with casual sex.  However, I think that people should be open to the idea that if the person you are pursuing does not enter into a sexual relationship immediately, then it does not necessarily mean that the relationship is going nowhere.",r

1nxlk4,1nxlk4,,"Sorry for weird sentence structure - typing on phone:  My sister got married this weekend, and on Friday after the rehearsal dinner, my brother (31M), whom I do not get along with at all, pressured my (25M) boyfriend, my sister's husband, and my other sister's boyfriend into going out for a what he called a ""guy's night"" before the wedding. First of all - I don't believe this is a conventional tradition the evening before a wedding. Second - there were about 20 guys attending this event orchestrated by my brother, who is notorious for hazing the boyfriends of his 4 sisters (I am 1 of 4).   My sister's husband called me about an hour after he left for the night asking to be picked up. My sister warned me not to get him, because she said, ""you better not help him. He got himself into this mess, and he can find his own way home."" He spent $60 on a cab and was home before midnight.   My other sister's boyfriend called her at 3AM, blackout drunk, asking for my mother's address (where we were sleeping the night before the big day). He stumbled in at 3:30.   My boyfriend texted me around that same time and said ""Your sister's boyfriend pussed out. I'm still raging on. Phones at 2%. In a car with your brothers friend."" Then I didn't hear from him until 8AM the next morning when he stumbled in my mom's front door accompanied by my brother, both extremely drunk.   According to my sister's boyfriend, they were at a strip club all night and into the morning. He called the cab before they left so he wasn't roped into going, but my boyfriend declined to opt out.   The next day, I asked what happened and if there were any fun stories (before I knew where he went), and he asserted he blacked out and didn't remember anything. Then pieces of the evening were coming back - he remembered being in my brother's friend's car; he doesn't remember anything else after 3AM.  The entire group of 20 guys were gone by about 1AM, except my sisters boyfriend who left at 3AM. My boyfriend, my brother, and my brother's friend drove drunk an hour away to go to a strip club and drove drunk an hour back. The whole family was getting ready for the wedding, taking pictures, and getting ready for a limo which departed at noon when they came back. I was so embarrassed by his behavior.   I'm so angry and disappointed that my boyfriend withheld that information from me, even after I asked several times. He asserts he thought I knew and that everyone else knew, and he didn't see a point in bringing it up. I didn't know until the next day when my sisters boyfriend divulged details of the night before.   I am so sickened by the thought of him being at a strip club for hours, not only because I had no clue where he was, but because the idea behind strip clubs makes me sick. They glorify the objectification of women. It's a place where taken men pay to be turned on and ogle other women. It's sickening. And how will I ever know what happened? My sister bartended at a strip club, and she told me horror stories about a guy code which enables men to do anything with these women because it's okay as long as they're strippers and in the appropriate venue. He was so drunk, and my brother is so intimidating and high-pressure, who knows what happened?  I don't want to be okay with him going. I don't agree with the concept of a strip club. It's socially accepted cheating in my opinion. I wish he would have told me about it, instead of assuming I knew.   I feel betrayed and disrespected. My boyfriend was probably trying to be cool and bond with my brother, who normally doesn't even acknowledge him because of our (my brother and me) damaged relationship.   I can't even talk to him.

qb357,qb357,,"On my way home on public transit this evening I was stopped and checked for a ticket, which I didn't have. Now, I'm part of the U-Pass system here in British Columbia, meaning that I pay for my passes through school tuition and every month I pick up a new monthly pass. My February pass was missing this morning and I figured I'd be okay riding on the March ticket I picked up a few days ago. This has never been a problem before - bus drivers never question me and I was even stopped at a checkpoint this weekend and allowed through with the March pass. This time though I wasn't so lucky, so I was referred to the transit police for a ticket.  Okay, whatever, technically I was in the wrong. So I walk over to the officers writing tickets as I put my March pass back in my wallet and I'm asked for my ID.  Now, you have to understand I'm uncomfortable showing my ID. I'm also uncomfortable with authority figures due to some stuff that happened in elementary school. I show ID at the liquor store, the border, etc, basically any situation where I'm required by law, otherwise I try not to let people see it. Here in British Columbia, we only have to show our ID at traffic stops, so I don't show it to the police. The two things we are required to provide: name and address.  I told the officer I'd prefer to provide the information verbally and he again asked for it. I explained it was my preference to not show my ID unless required by law. The officer told me he was asking me for it and therefore I had to produce it; I told him that my understanding was that I'm only required to provide my name and address to the police, and that if I was required by law to produce my ID I would.  He looked irritated and started drilling me with questions about why I wouldn't show my ID, and I kept stating it was personal preference and that I would provide my name and address in compliance with the law. He told me that I was ""elevating the situation"" from a provincial matter (transit code) to a federal matter (criminal code) by not providing my ID. I asked if I would be arrested for failing to provide ID and he kept restating this without answering my question. Another officer came over and started asking the same questiion, along with things like ""What are you, a lawyer?"" And asking other officers ""what is with this guy"" and the like.  So by this point I was irritated, too, and a little intimidated. I told them that I would give the required information verbally and otherwise wouldn't be answering any more questions. The officer eventually asked for and wrote down my info, including age, DOB, height, weight, etc, which I don't have to provide but did anyways cuz why not rite?  When the officer asked for my driver's license ID number. I told him I didn't know it and he told me to take out my ID and read it to him, which I refused to do. Eventually he gave up and called in my information. He then asked for my mother's maiden name, which is a keyword I provided when applying for my license to prevent identity theft. I again said I would only provide it if required to by law.  He told me that if I didn't provide the information he would arrest me for obstructing a peace officer. When I refused, he told me I was under arrest. Another officer read my my rights and told me. One officer took my wallet from my inside jacket pocket and checked my ID. I was told I was released from custody and I left the station.  My ID number was never recorded on the ticket.  tl;dr I want to make sure I'm in the right before I go file a complaint against this guy. My understanding of the situation is this: The only information I'm required by law to provide to a police officer is my name and address, which I gave when asked. Despite this, I was arrested and searched, not for failing to provide information, but for obstructing a peace officer. Did I actually do anything illegal? Was I wrongfully arrested and searched?

When you spend time apart, you tend to idolize the good things and downplay the bad...having said that, there are a couple of factors and questions I would have.  Is she currently in a relationship now?  What is the story with her baby's daddy?  What kind of jobs do you both currently have?  I think that letting something like this eat at you is a bad thing, so our goal is to get a resolution.  I'm not a fan of just doing nothing but I'm also not a fan of dropping everything and moving.  I am still interested in the answers to my previous questions but let's build on the situation a little without knowing those answers.  What is stopping you from taking a long weekend from work and going to visit her up in Michigan?  Or even having her come visit down to Texas?  If those options are plausible, make the trip with both of you knowing the emotional roller coaster that long weekend will be.  Depending on how long either of you spend in the respective other's state, spend the first couple of days riding the high of the strong feelings you both think you still have.  Go on dates, have fun, have sex if you want (with protection of course).  But you both have to agree before the trip is made that the last day or two must be spent in honest communication with each other.  Do you both still want to be together? What would be involved in making that work?  Voice your frustrations or feelings from the previous relationship...talk about the pain of the miscarriage.  Cry on each other's shoulders.  Then go home.  Keep in contact, work out the things you talked about.  If its something that you both want, make the effort to make it happen...somebody will have to move.  Know the risks involved in making this decision.  But fuck it, if it's something you both want just walk to the edge of the cliff with each other and her child and jump (metaphorically of course).  Or when you spend time together again, you might just realize its happy past memories that you now have to get past.  Things won't ever be the same and one or both of you don't want it bad enough to make the sacrifices to make it work.   You're never going to know unless you start walking toward the edge of the cliff where you can't see what's at the bottom...at least start shuffling towards the edge.",r

We've been hanging out for about a week now and it may have gone too fast already with full on intercourse. Since her x-husband cheated on her I know she has a lot of time to heal. I made the mistake of suggesting that we discuss what we are so we are on the same page. I told her I like her a lot and to continue what we are doing.

In September, the two of us will be going to different universities but we hope to stay in a relationship.  When we first met, she wasn't very confident. She wasn't skinny or overweight either - she was at an uncomfortable weight that she always hid behind baggy clothes. In the past 6 months, she's lost weight due to her medication and felt extremely more confident. Maybe 9 months before that, she was extremely drunk and said ""now that I'm more confident, more girls will come to me."" and I asked her if she would turn those girls down for me and she said she didn't know.  That conversation has been in my head for months now. So many people are starting to talk to her, and a lot of drunk bisexuals make jokes and flirt with her. It's just really upsetting. Even guys at school are telling her she looks amazing and that her confidence levels are going up and even men are getting interested in her.  Meanwhile, my confidence has dropped ever since dating her and I've come to start my battle with a lot of negative things from the past and my biggest concerns are  1) she cheats on me in university with another woman who doesn't have my type of emotional baggage or just goes it for the rush of something new  2) she finds me irrelevant in her life anymore   She even suspects that I'd cheat on her in university with a guy and thinks that I'd find it better so I wouldn't come back to her. I couldn't cheat before because I've been on the opposite stick of that before and I fully admit wouldn't happen again because it is the most disgusting feeling.

c3qo082,p7ih0,,"Get out. This isn't some minor thing like ""she forgot to put the lid on the toothpaste"" but it seriously influences a lot of factors, that you might even be unaware of now (money, contribution to household chores, raising children, entertainment, food).   Let me tell you a little story... I was married (for three years) to a guy who, when I first met him, seemed more liberal than he became. After we got married (we were engaged for a year and a half), he got progressively more fundamental in his beliefs and I got progressively more liberal. He wanted to impose strict(er) gender roles (e.g. me not finishing my graduate program and staying home and having kids) than I was comfortable with. He and I didn't agree on churches (i didn't want to attend one where women couldn't be pastors and I certainly don't believe that the Bible is inerrant), which added more conflict. He used religion as a control mechanism, and we went to Christian counseling, which really didn't help the situation at all. I ended up leaving, and it was a tough decision that alienated a lot of people from my life (even my parents for awhile), because all my ""Christian friends"" wouldn't support a divorce--even though staying would mean more emotional abuse toward me.  As a child who was raised in a semi-fundamentalist environment, I wouldn't put a kid through that. It's not a flippant, casual thing of ""yeah, our kids will be raised fundies"" but there's a lot of brainwashing and guilt that sets you up for damaged relationships in life, unless you work hard at overcoming it.  If she wants a relationship with a partner with more shared beliefs than what you have and you can't give that to her, you need to let her go. I realize you said you didn't want an ""exit strategy"" but you or she will be entering your marriage with hostility or resentment--and that's really not healthy.",r

5jdmo5,5jdmo5,Vewy_nice,"I have been trying to lease an apartment to get out of my parents house for the past year now.  One important thing to note about me is that I hate lying and being deceitful, so unlike a lot of people with reptiles as pets, I have been disclosing the fact that I own 3 small snakes (All under 5 feet) on my rental applications. I am 24 years old and live in New Hampshire. I have excellent credit and I am an engineer making a great salary. There is no reason to decline my applications, really.  There is an obvious negative bias, and lots of irrational fear of snakes, and I'm aware of that. But I have been declined FOUR times in a row thus far simply because I own a common harmless pet, and I feel like it is unfair. I feel like if I instead owned geckos or a chameleon or something, it would not be such a problem, which is what upsets me the most.  I am a responsible keeper, and take it very seriously. My snakes are housed in an inconspicuous purpose-built reptile rack system, I feed them only frozen rodents, and I use only under-tank resistive heat tape. This eliminates the possibility of: Escape, introduction of live rodents, and fires caused by heat lamps.  Does a landlord have any leverage over the issue of the ""creep"" factor? The most recent place, I was very fond of, but he declined me based on the fact that OTHER people might be afraid of the snakes, not even himself! His exact words were: ""Another tenant might see one through a window and get scared.""   My pets do not have any impact on the unit, do not produce any odor, don't make any noise, and spend 95% of their time curled up under a fake rock in a plastic sweater box in a cabinet. I have been getting very upset at my inability to rent due to these harmless creatures.  I have recently started writing ""small tank-bound reptiles"", or ""0-impact tank-bound pets"", but I always get asked ""What kind of pets?""   What legal right do I have to not disclose what kind of ""tank-bound reptile"" I own? I feel like consistently trying to hide what is there will only make landlords more weary.  I saw somewhere that tank or cage-bound pets are considered furniture under some jurisdiction. If a rental says ""NO PETS"", I can see it possibly being a problem, but if the agreement only mentions ""No cats or dogs"", do I legally have to make my pets known? If I were to hide this fact, nobody would ever know they exist, they are such low-impact. I was even declined from a place that boasted ""All pets welcome"". All pets except snakes, obviously.  Also, If I do end up going the ""keep it a secret"" route, what legal action (if any) could a landlord take if they find out about my ""furniture"", and ""think it's creepy""? or they are afraid of them?   I am afraid of guns, but I don't limit my housing search strictly to places that do not have gun owners, I just simply accept the fact they are everywhere and that I just have to live with my phobia. Snakes are everywhere, they live all around us. I am just upset and trying to see what I can do to increase my chances of acceptance.  Thanks a lot Reddit.",l

He felt like he carried the emotional weight of the relationship and tried for two years to make it better but two months ago he broke-up with me because he had become bitter and could no longer take it.  I am still deeply in love with him and he says the same about me.

I am working on it daily cause I want nothing more than for us to be together.  In the meantime, he is dating and sleeping with other people, which is devastating.  We are also still sleeping together and talking on a regular basis.  He claims that dating other people isn't the reason he broke-up with me--he just needs to live life without factoring me into his decisions.  It took awhile but I am supporting this theory.

The best way is to show the girl how you feel and build rapport and have her display those same emotions back. This is the only real way for a girl to like you beyond just friends. Unfortunately once you fall into the friendzone it is nearly impossible to get out.  It's been a year since you met, and although there is no one size fit all for girls, by this time it is extremely likely you have fallen into the friendzone. Now you must weight wether you do want to go after her with the eventual outcome of not being friends anymore ( trust me this can happen) or you would rather keep her just as a friend and work on getting over your feelings and finding someone else.   It's grim but if you really must know, show her don't tell her. In fact telling her will put her in a very awkward position and will probably lead to rejection. Sorry the whole time thing makes the outcome very grim, it would have been better if you only knew her for a few days to weeks but even at that a girl can friendzone you.  As a man to man, just know that if this doesn't workout, there are plenty other girls out there who are probably better for you. I can tell you are heavily emotionally invested since you say it's weird if you don't talk everyday. I've been there bud and it's a damn near friendzone.

obk2p,obk2p,C_IsForCookie,"My girlfriend broke up with me a week ago. Instead of writing a huge story, I'll just say this:  - It's hard when someone you fall for breaks up with you.   - It's hard when they are the first person you've been with who says ""it's ok"" instead of ""I can't believe you're such a fucking idiot"" when you do something stupid.   - It's hard after you've divulged your darkest secrets to each other and realize that you've never met anyone who's seen your perspective like they have before.   - It's hard after they introduced you to their entire family and they all LOVED you.   - It's hard after her mother told you that she's glad you're in her daughter's life.   - It's hard after she told you that you are part of the family.   - It's hard after you've fallen for her family just as hard as you have her.   - It's hard after she tells you that you are the first person she could see herself falling in love with, and it doesn't scare her one bit.   - It's hard when it all ends the day after coming back from a trip to New York together for new years.   - It's hard when they tell you *""I got some bad news on the phone today and I really want to be with you, but I can't, and I can't tell you why, but I need you to understand. It's out of my control. Maybe one day we can be together again.""* And they kiss you goodbye.     - It's hard when they won't speak to you much after the breakup, because now you're not sure what to believe.   - It's hard when while all of this is happening, you have to see them at work, and know that you won't even be able to speak to each other.   - It's hard when after all of this you do something to upset the person you care for, and you can't even tell them how sorry you are because you can't even speak to them.  That's what I'm going through. It hurts.  I can't tell her that I'm sorry for telling a co-worker that we broke up which upset her even though she had already told other co-workers (she didn't want him to know her business), so I'm telling all of you that I'm sorry because I need to say it. I could only tell her through 1 meaningless text, but I meant it. I'm afraid to lose her trust over it.  The most messed up part? I got a text from her today telling me she was upset at me for telling that coworker we broke up... and I felt better. I felt better that she was upset at me. I'm so used to girlfriends who psychologically abuse me, that after this girl, who I've never had a single argument with told me she was upset at me, I actually felt better because it felt normal to me. That shit makes me sad.  I just wish I knew why it ended. Even if it's because she doesn't want to be with me anymore, after all the plans we made, and the secrets we've shared, I just wish I knew why it's over. It's the one thing she didn't tell me.",r

They have been inside the home, conducted interviews with the relevant parties, and have determined that this child is NOT being neglected.  YOU seem to have NO idea what constitutes neglect in the state of WA.    A child over the age of 10 can be left unsupervised.  Above that, it is determined by the individual circumstances whether or not the child is being adequately provided for.  NO child is entitled to a home cooked meal, only food.  The parents provide food.  You don't like that food.  Sucks, but we don't tell parents WHAT they can and cannot feed their child.  Plus, this child has the ability to access a home cooked meal any time they want by cooking for themselves.  They CHOOSE to eat the way they do.  Non issue.  14 year olds are OFTEN skinny.  They're growing.  Unless his doctor has concerns about his weight, he is fine.  CPS knows how to spot a malnourished child.  He's a skinny teen.    You can't make CPS do what you want just because you don't like the choices these parents are making.  They are legal.

There was obviously no damage, so I just waved it off and headed on my way. She catches up with me a couple of miles down the road and says that I backed into her. There is a small scuff on my mirror (a ""no damage"" claim per the auto body place I went to) and she had some of the plastic that rubbed off my mirror near her door handle. The incident took place on private property with no video available to show exactly what happened. The police officer said the damage could probably just be rubbed off, and that the deductible would far exceed the cost of fixing it, but he still cited me for leaving the scene.

Telling the president's lawyers could, in theory, lead to them softening their stance on whether or not the president should sit down and talk to Mueller, especially if they've uncovered evidence of crimes that don't implicate the president, but that the president's testimony could help prosecute (e.g., Cohen).",l

4su99q,4su99q,TreeLove520,"A few days ago I went fishing with my fiancee's sister and her boyfriend, whom my fiancee and I have been staying with. Said boyfriend got belligerent after a few to many beers and started driving crazy down some old dirt roads. During the course of his angry drunken driving, I was thrown from the bed of the truck at about 30mph, messing up my left knee pretty bad. He took off without us (me, my fiancee, his girlfriend, and a mutual friend), got back to the house and began throwing our (fiancee and I)  stuff out, all over the yard. When we finally got picked up and made it back to the house, an ambulance took me to the hospital, and a sheriff's deputy took him to jail. He's since been released. I was in the middle of the hiring process for a new job, which the injuries prevented me from getting. Do I have grounds for a lawsuit? I'm not sure what to do here. Now I have no job, no home (staying on fiancee's grandparent's couch currently) and no means of providing for my fiancee and our son. I'm really lost here, and I need some advice.

c3aqzn1,nnslz,Janube,"Handling this in reverse order-  1. Yes, I have considered it. I would prefer for her to break up with me so that I'm not holding her back. I wouldn't be horribly distraught because it's been a 3 month relationship, and I've had partners who've been in this exact situation before. That's why I'm trying to examine this as thoroughly as possible instead of being completely judgmental.  2. The expectations of society in a liberal arts college tend to get fuzzed a lot. Hardly any of my friends or past partners have lived by society's expectations in many roles.  &gt; you're clearly a very confused young man  This is my favorite line, and I really don't want to turn this into an argument, but if you think you've got it all down, you're underthinking things.  Her pain is real, yes, which is why this question even exists. The arguable least pain that could possibly come to her without longer-term consequences is in me staying with her, saying nothing, and seeing her off to study abroad. The separation will be for pragmatic purposes, which will significantly soften the blow for her.  It's at that point that culturally prescribed notions of total monogamy give us the question of moral obligation regarding transparency. It would not benefit her, but culture says I should tell her anyway.  If we're prescribing to some cultural expectations, do we have to take them all? Are we allowed to pick and choose?  I disagree on flirting being tantamount to cheating necessarily. Certainly, if the type of flirting you're doing is extremely overt, suggestive, and lusting, but if we're to say that feeling the adrenaline from a well-placed compliment is the equivalent of cheating, then aren't you cheating simply by receiving a compliment that makes you feel that way? What matters? Intent or content? Or a mixture of both? Where are you drawing the line here at cheating? What is the minimum cutoff point for you for a conversation to be considered cheating on someone? Furthermore, who are you to decide? I don't recall our culture recognizing anywhere that flirting is cheating. Largely because there aren't official rules to this sort of thing.  If we go from a legal standpoint, it's not committing adultery. There's no physical interaction. If we go by the ""lust"" theory, then porn would be considered ""cheating"" too, and in this culture, it typically isn't seen as that, though the moral leanings of pornography can have its own topic.  If you're confused on the content of the flirting with Melissa, there was no suggestiveness towards each other, no talk of relations with her.   I'm similarly not certain I agree with your assertion- the sooner she's free of me, the sooner she'll get over me. a. I like use of ""free"" implying I'm her captor. Clever... Can we keep this free of insults please?  b. pragmatically speaking, if a person reacts to being dumped outright with depression and distrust from the dating community for a period of time, isn't it worse than being broken up with for a logical reason with feelings of loneliness (but NOT distrust or depression) and possibly despair?  It precludes the popular ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" model of society we're running, which isn't proven to be horribly effective.   Regardless, I've come to a decision thanks to the help of you and this thread. I appreciate your input and the thoughtful remarks.  I'd beg you not to consider me callous without having lived my life and my situations, but I can see that plea will fall on deaf ears as you've already made your judgment.",r

543qrp,543qrp,Throwaway44033,"This is in the United States. I posted this a bit ago but didn't receive a response.   So my partner and I started a digital marketing business about two years ago. Eventually we were approached by a video game skin betting website that promised us revenue share for help with developing a marketing strategy / plan involving Graphic design, Google adwords, content creator sponsorship deals, and other components of advertisement.  (If you're unfamiliar with what kind of website I am talking about, read more about it here http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/ ) Or read my TLDR at the bottom of the page.  Anyways, i wasn't comfortable in helping a site like theirs that facilitates betting, even if it is just virtual items, so I told them no. My partner however decided to take it upon himself to accept their offer on his personal behalf rather than the business' by utilizing resources of his own. From what I know, he used to get revenue share from this website in return for his work until the site shut down a couple of weeks ago.  Could he be in trouble? Is his income legitimate? He's my business partner in my current business, my friend, and I want what's best for him AND my business. I told him to not get involved in providing services to a site like that, but he just kept telling me that there was nothing wrong with providing his services to anyone whatsoever.  TL;DR For the website: A game goes by the name Counter Global. This game allows users to obtain virtual goods. These virtual goods are tied to the account of the user that obtains them, but there is a trading system in place to transfer these goods to other accounts. Certain collectors or individuals trade these items or sell them to other users for money depending on how rare they are. This website allows users to bet with these virtual goods.  TL;DR for everything: Business partner decided to personally provide marketing related services to a shady website that operates in a sort of grey area (I guess, still not 100% familiar with how these sites even operate.) He in return got revenue share. Is his income legitimate / Is he safe?   I've told him to see an attorney, he told me he saw one and was told it was fine, but I'm not sure if I should believe him or not.  Anyways any insight is appreciated. He's been a life long friend and he's a vital component of a lot of business that we do together, i'd like to know what this obscure business venture might mean for him.",l

Then my sister, her fiancé, my boyfriend, and I were going bowling then out to a club. My boyfriend hates the club, but he said he'd go because its my birthday, even though I told him he didn't have to. Here's where it starts.   He is an hour and a half late picking me up for ""breakfast"" because he overslept. I can deal with ten or fifteen minutes late, but I was really, really angry with him. From his attitude, it seemed like he was mad at me for being mad at him. Then (this is where I feel a little bratty), he forgot my birthday present at his house. So after breakfast we drove back to his house so he could get the present, which he couldn't find because he hid it and couldn't remember where. We were at his house for almost forty five minutes before he finally found it. So he had to pick up something for his mom for Mother's Day, which is fine. We stopped at a bookstore where he surprised me and said I could pick out a book. So after that, we went and got my mom's present, then raced back to my house to be there in time for my sister and her fiancé to be there to do presents. Presents and dinner went well. On the way back to my house from dinner, my folks and I were joking with my boyfriend about him being late. Nothing offensive was said, we just joked with him about it and he was laughing and joking along.   So we get back home and have cake, then it was off to my sisters apartment so we could go bowling then to the club. The ride up between me and him was silent. When we got there he asked if we were going to bowl right away, and I said we probably would. He rolled his eyes, and got out of the car. So everything is okay for a little while, we go to the bowling alley, start drinking and start bowling. I threw two gutter balls on the second frame of the first game (I'm not a good bowler), and after a few more frames, he jokes, ""You know you'd be doing a lot better if you didn't throw two gutter balls that frame."" So we had a laugh, and then he does the same thing. Throws two gutter balls. So he sits down and I lean over and joke, ""You know you'd be doing a lot better if you didn't just double gutter."" He looks at me and almost yells, ""You're not going to be like this all night, are you?"" So I asked him the same thing because that pissed me off.   So he sat like a grump for a little while, then went outside to smoke, came back in and apologized to me. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing and I said, ""We'll something has to be wrong because you snapped at me."" He continued to tell me it was nothing.   So we finished bowling then went to the club where he sat at one of the tables and played on his phone the WHOLE time. He didn't even buy me a drink. Not one. Again, I feel a little bratty about that, but I shouldn't have been paying for my drinks the entire night. My sister bought me one and her fiancé bought me a shot. I paid for the rest of my drinks.   So as we were going home, I asked to stop at ihop because I was drunk and hungry. Everything seemed to go well, we ate, he brought me home, helped me inside, got me to bed, locked up the house and left. As soon as he left my room I started crying.   Yesterday was the one day I didn't want him to be late. Then on top of that, he was being a douche the whole day/night.   So, am I being a brat about this or do you see something wrong with this too?   TL;DR: boyfriend was being a jerk on the day of my birthday celebration and I can't tell if I'm just being a brat or if he really was being a jerk.",r

It's a rather small field with not a whole lot of job opportunities. About a month ago she gets an offer for a job in Manitoba (we live in Alberta) which will be great for her. She leaves on Monday for a few days for a ""trial run"" of this job, for she doesn't want to pack up her life if the job isn't a perfect fit.   The issue I'm having is, I want her to be happy with her career and life. This job (by all accounts) seems perfect for her, but does require living in Manitoba. The selfish side of me doesn't want her to enjoy it so she doesn't move. I have considered moving there as wel,l if she decides to take it, but I haven't talked to her about it since the relationship is rather new (about 5 months, but we've known each other for a few years)  It's really hard to describe the way I feel about her and our relationship over the Internet, so pardon me if I sound like a naive teenager, but I do really love this woman and am having an issue on how to deal with this/approach her with it.   Granted, she doesn't know if she wants it yet or not, so these feeling could end up being all for naught, but I believe she will love it and it terrifies me.

1mv8xu,1mv8xu,powderblue01,"I (M25) haven't been happy in my 18 month relationship with cohabiting girlfriend (F30) for a long time. I have had doubts about the longevity of the relationship from the beginning due to differences between us, but have tried to make it work as I wanted a relationship so badly after being single for five years.  I got way drunk at a work function last weekend and made out with another girl but nothing more. I told my girlfriend the next afternoon and after understandably going crazy she said she would give me another chance but needed to know that I truly wanted to be with her, I said I did.   Next morning I broke down and told her that I hadn't been happy for a long time and that while I love her I'm just not on the same level as she is in the relationship. She said she had no idea idea and said we should take a break to think about how best to move ahead.  She came back yesterday from a week at her mother's and told me about how she has realised how much she was putting onto me as far as supporting both of us financially and emotionally, and she had started exercising and has job interviews and has reconnected with her friends and would like us to try out a new way of being together.  I had in the meantime made the decision to stop stringing her along just to make her happy and to be true to my feelings as in the long run it will be best for both.  After both of us saying what we had decided I yielded and said we would try it out. An hour later I went back to her and said that this would actually just be giving the chance just for the sake of it and that I knew that it wouldn't work out and in two weeks we would be back where we are.  She has said she doesn't care even if there is only a 1% chance of it working out, she'd be more upset about breaking up without trying to make it work out than giving up.  So again I gave in to trying to keep the relationship even though I still don't think it will work out in the end.  Now things are weird and I'm sad all the time.

pyu90,pyu90,,"I'll try to make this as short as possible (which usually doesn't happen):  I belong to a very tight group of friends (guys and gals). One of said friends, I have come to learn, has a pretty serious crush on me. I like him, and we'd be perfect together, but.. a few months ago, freshly out of a painful break up, I slept with another friend in said group, not once, but twice. I regret it. He's a huge asshole who absolutely sweet talked me into sleeping with him, and now treats me like a less-than-a-friend. So the problem is, these two guys are obviously friends with each other. Absolutely no one (except my very best friend) knows about the short-lived fuck buddy situation. We agreed not to tell anyone. But, I find myself having some serious feelings for the crush-friend. Having known him for a long time, I know he can be pretty jealous about things, and quite overly sensitive. I don't even know if I could ever really give into these feelings now because my choices are 1) tell him what happened before he finds out any other way and have him (and the rest of my friends) think awfully of me, or 2) don't tell him and try to let go of that guilt (impossible?) 3) not even attempt a relationship, break his heart and my own..  I don't think I could enter a relationship without telling him. But I am fully aware that there will probably be no relationship if I do. Fuck-buddy friend is not really a constant presence in our lives, but does make the occasional appearance.

1iphdu,1iphdu,,"Where to start... I'm an 18 year old guy, I've had relationships when I was younger and I can say I genuinely had feelings for them, but I wouldn't say I've had a serious relationship. I'm going to lay this out as a sort of time line up to now.   At 14 I had my first proper crush. I was crazy over this girl. We were together for a few weeks but we was young and she wasn't really as interested as I was. I was seriously into this girl and she hurt me a lot, even though I was 14.   I got over that, now fast forward to 15, and I have been talking to another girl for quite a few months, but didn't want a relationship with her. She ended up getting with someone else and this really hurt me for a year, even though I kept putting off a relationship with her.  This is where I first noticed a problem. I could not understand why I was hurting even though I declined the relationship.   Now I'm 16, and met another girl. Same again, things are cool, we're seeing each other, then I realise I don't want a relationship, even though I have feelings for her. Things end, I'm hurt again. Now I'm starting to notice a pattern.   Pretty soon after the previous, I met another girl. We spoke for 6months or so, she messed me about and we never ended up getting together, but I never had this feeling with her (of not wanting to be together). I was really into her, and it may be because we didn't get serious enough that this feeling occur, but I don't know. Maybe because I wasn't in control.   After a gap of a couple of years, it brings me to my current situation. When I went to college, I saw this girl around and we would both catch each other staring at one another. I eventually started talking to her and I really like her. Over the course of sixth months, she opens up and let's me in as she was worried about getting hurt. Things are great, I'm happy, she's happy, and then it happens again. She wants to move into a relationship and there's just something in my head stopping me. I like her, a lot, I know I do, yet something is just stopping me. Then as soon as I let them go, I'm hurt because I desperately want them back.   Now, I'm aware this can be because I'm young, or they're simply not the right person for me, but I just want some opinions. In my head, this girl is perfect for me, she's so kind, she makes me happy, her family think I'm great and there is nothing bad, yet something won't let me get into something serious.

For my sake I won't go into too much detail, but suffice it to say, it has given me a wide ability of skills and put me in the company of some very interesting people.  I've noticed, at least for the past year and a half, that I have been followed, my phone calls have been intercepted and I have had drones &amp; helicopters fly directly over me, both at my home and while driving on the highway. This has happened very frequently; to the point of it being very obvious. I have proof, videotaped, license plates numbers, IP addresses, etc, that I used to verify this through a friend. Also, I have done things at random, just to verify this fact, and virtually every time I have seen the same people and cars at places that only someone close to me or triangulating my cellular signal would know where I would be. Also, I have had a PI friend, take pictures, trace license plates, and perform other duties to document this. At this point, it is beginning to become a pain, and I would like it to stop. I am certain and have proof, that the perpetrators belong to Homeland Security, DOD, the FBI, and local law enforcement.

The first occurred while my husband and I were on vacation out of state, and since the first picture I have probably been sent five more.  These are from unknown numbers, usually in the 619 area code.  I am not really sure what to do.  Blocking is not effective because the number is never the same.   They usually come with some sort of message, referencing a conversation that involved sending these pictures to (allegedly) someone else.  The first time this happened, I actually responded to the sender, and told them never to contact me again, ect, and they actually responded and apologized.  Since then, I haven't bothered.   How are these random people getting my phone number to text me these pictures?  Is there anything I can do legally to have this stopped?  Could it be some random website has my number listed for some weird reason?

c2bm0sh,jef4i,toldyaso,"I don't know what your particular case is, but I can tell you that alot of guys make the mistake of thinking they're being ""friendzoned"", when what's actually happening is that they're going after girls who are way, way out of their league and they never had a snowball's chance in hell with in the first place.  When a girl is way, way too good looking for a guy who is nice to her and interesting to her, she'll friendzone him as a matter of course.  That's a totally different dynamic than when a girl who would normally be attracted to you or to a guy of your ""type"" friendzones you for emotional or logistical reasons.  So, knowing nothing about your looks or what kind of women you're going after, the best advice I would give is to be realistic about the kind of women you can reel in.  If you go after nothing but 8s and 9s and you are a 5, you're going to get friendzoned every single time.    (Another, more obscure truth is that if you're a 9 and you're going after 6s and 7s, they'll friendzone you too, out of protective instinct.)  Also, like 3fish said, getting friendzoned isn't the end of the world, it's not even necessarily a bad thing.  GO OUT with your female friends.  Most guys have no idea how much more attractive you become to other women when they see you out and about with another woman, especially an attractive one.  When I was single I used to keep a few girls as friends just for the purpose of when I went out to clubs or whatever, I would bring them with me.  When I went to clubs by myself or with guy friends, I didn't do nearly as well with the ladies as I did when I went with female friends.  For whatever reason, when women see a guy with an attractive girl, that guy automatically becomes more attractive.  Just something to think about.",r

While on a student visa , she met my dad who was a citizen and married him right after she finished getting her degree from college. She never mentioned anything about a greencard but I do know that they went on later to have me. While she was pregnant with me , she found out that my dad had eloped with another woman. She eventually gave birth to me in America. I am a citizen of the country and I have my documents. About 2 weeks later , she decides to move back to her country. No stamps were issued for overstaying according to her. I am currently staying with my dad and she is  interested in visiting me for my graduation. Is it possible for her to get a visa , as well as is it possible for me to sponsor her in the future ?     --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",l

h5ut4,h5ut4,,"I met my girlfriend three years ago and things have been great ever since. She is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen and do not envy my colleagues significant others in any way, shape or form. My girlfriend is the girl I wanted and took, so to say. I plan on marrying her and having many children.  Anybody can have the girl, all you have to do is be in charge and confident. I actually first spoke to her, her name is Helen, when I was nineteen and she was seventeen. This was the first thing I did right, I was going for a younger, more naive girl who would believe me if I told her I could spit turds out of my butt fast enough to propel me forward like a rocket. I made her think that I was some Don Juan with a cock like Shane Diesel's, but I also made her feel unwanted and worthless by illustrating how blatantly ignorant she was. I then proceeded to tell her that she was fat and grotesque, despite the fact that she was absolutely beautiful. She was on my nuts in no time, she wanted it!  I ignored her outright and would occasionally pick up the phone to answer her calls, and despite the fact that we had relatively enjoyable conversations, I made her feel as if the stuff coming out of her mouth was the stupidest shit I'd ever heard. You see, I was slowly breaking her confidence apart.  At first, I didn't give her any pet names or anything, but then I began to call her cute things like ""whore"" and ""slut"" and ""bitch"" and ""slutty-whore-cunt-bitch"". I eventually conditioned her to think that this was alright, I also made her feel as if she wasn't deserving enough to be called anything else. I just made her feel ugly in general.  After a while, I was calling her every name in the book and she just felt like shit all the time. She was always under the impression that she was doing something wrong, even when her friends tried to explain to her that I was just being a controlling douchebag. She eventually lost all her friends and began devoting her life to me in a sense.  When the names no longer had the same *sting* to them that they used to carry, I began hitting her. At first, it started off as just rough treatment, I'd push her face and tell her to shut her fucking mouth and get me a fucking beer, then I'd fuck the shit out of her asshole despite the fact that she was *extremely* uncomfortable doing that. I'd do things to degrade her, like put my dirty shit covered, bloody cock down her throat or make her cry and tell her how much I loved her and that she was beautiful (just to make sure that if someone else said it to her, she'd automatically associate it with violence and breakdown).  Finally, during about the third year, I'd get rip roaring drunk and beat her savagely, tell her that if I ever caught her with another guy, that would be the end. Recently, I toned it down because it would seem that I finally broke her, also she's pregnant and I don't want to cause her to miscarry. Hopefully it's a boy and I can show him how to treat a lady.  Just remember, nice guys finish last. No ho' wants a fucking nice guy. So don't be a queer, be a man! Every woman has the urge to be controlled.",r

4pwcpt,4pwcpt,Aggiegirl2013,"So a little back story. My Grandfather was basically estranged from everyone in the family except for me. He lived in Florida, I was 20 and in college in California (have always lived in CA) when he passed away.  His step-daughter, whom I have never met, called to notify me of his passing. He was 91 at the time. Basically she handled everything. I was told that he wanted me to have his vehicle, a 2011 Buick, but never received anything. She sent me a couple photo albums, and a model plane of his, his military service flag, and that was about it. None of his other personal items, no papers, nothing that was really his. Never saw a will, and was never informed if his wife ever passed and what happened with the estate.  So basically,  1) No clue if he had a will or not  2) He was remarried to a woman who was living in a assisted living facility, she had (has? Not sure if she has passed or not) Alzheimer's  3) His step-daughter told me that he wanted me to have his car, a 2011 purchase. But now she says that Medicaid (his wife is in assisted living and on medicaid) wont let them do anything with the car.  My Questions are these:   1- Is there a way to see if he had a will without going through her?   2- Do I have any options? Since he was married I assume that means it all goes to her, and if she had a will her kids would get everything.   Thank you! Any advice is appreciated!",l

96kk0w,96kk0w,lunarghosts,"I'll start with some background. 30 years ago or so, when my father was a minor, his older siblings and their friends attempted to cross the border illegally. Obviously that didn't go well, and it stayed on my father's record. He's had to reapply for a visa every 1, 5, sometimes 10 years or so. He's also received several pardons for what happened. Growing up, it was never a problem other than a minor albeit stressful period where my dad had to wait a long while for his visa.  I was born in the United States and am considered a citizen, I'm also 25 years old. I live, study, and work in California at the moment. My brother was also born in the United States. All of our hospital bills were payed properly and my father has never been in another legal incident (I'll come back to this in a moment). I lived in Mexico most of my life but moved back to California to attend college.  Last year, my dad had to reapply for his visa and was denied. The consul apparently didn't believe that my father was able to pay our hospital bills when we were born. Her ""reasoning"" was that there was no way my dad could obtain such a decent job with his type of ""background"" that would allow him to afford paying our bills. My dad had all the papers to prove everything, including the pardons he's received, but the consul wouldn't accept them. She declined his visa and put some kind of stamp that puts him under a ""Not recommended"" list. I'm not too sure what that means, but my dad left the building in tears and called us in the middle of a panic attack.  His current job requires him to be crossing the border often, as the company also has offices in the US. He's also supposed to fly out of San Diego, California to Germany and Poland later in the year. I believe he said he tried explaining this to the consul, but she refused to listen or believe him. I was shocked when I found out, and it's been really tough on him and my family (half of us live in California, while my parents and the other half of my family live in Mexico).   He tried to apply once again for a visa but was also declined. Needless to say he's felt defeated and very stressed due to what may happen with his job. What are our options at this point? What can I do to help in this situation? My parents only wanted their visas to travel and visit me and my brother, but would petitioning to bring them to the US be a better option?",l

jldn2,jldn2,,"ok i'm going to provide as much details as concisely as i can, because i'm actually about to head out for lunch with my girlfriend and would really like to see some advice by the time i get home.  i've been with my girlfriend for 3 yrs, but all 3 years have been long distance. first 2 years was good, but the third yr is when we really got going. we are currently in the beginning of the 4th yr.  first 2 years we actually both agreed to be non-exclusive since we're in a LDR, but in the third yr we both committed to an exclusive relationship. this happened after she started making more efforts to communicate with me, for example daily skype chats etc. this did not bother me as some guys would feel, in fact i enjoyed it because it made me feel that she was indeed making an effort with our relationship and we both decided to become exclusive.   we made the decision to be exclusive in the beginning of the third year, and because of reasons i'd prefer not to go into because in my opinion it's somewhat irrelevant to the discussion, we agreed she will quit her job and i will support her financially. i am currently still in college but due to some strategic investments as well as some family money, i am able to support her for the time being - or at least, based on my own finances, i'm able to support her through the next 10-12 months.  everything has been going pretty great, but recently i started developing doubts and uncertainty. i really have no idea why - i am currently visiting, we are still having great sex, we are still generally getting along very well when we go out, everything doesn't seem to have changed. the only thing is suddenly recently i started desiring to be single again, despite how great the relationship has been going.  i started wondering things like ""if i somehow decide to break up with her, how will it go down?"" and things like ""fuck, 70% of her facebook photos are of us. i'm really not sure how badly she will take it if i break up with her."". this is very confusing to me because nothing has changed, other than a few small arguments we had which was quickly resolved through talking it out. this uncertainty is not a result of those argument, i don't think.  the issue i have right now is that we have both discussed marriage before, and i believe she expects us to go down that road eventually. even though i've explicitly stated this won't happen in the next 5 years as i want to build my career and be able to be financially strong before we do that, i believe she is still expecting that our relationship will ultimately lead to marriage.  however, she has also mentioned about a year or so ago in passing that ""if a man does not want to marry a girl eventually, he should not drag out a relationship until the girl is older because then she will have much more trouble finding a husband so it's very unfair to her"". i agree with this, and it's part of what's bothering me because if i'm having doubts now, i don't know if the right thing to do is to end it now.  yet, i still really like her right now and don't wish to end it at this moment. this is what's causing my confusion because i cannot imagine ending it with her now, yet i am unsure if i want to spend the rest of my life with her. plus, although financially my supporting her is not a big issue at the moment, i can't help but feel that if i'm going to end it, i might as well end it sooner so i can 'save' on the money which i can use for myself.  i'm really confused right now, i don't know why i'm feeling this way and right now i'm visiting her and sometimes i can't bring myself to be as loving to her as i used to because i'm afraid to continue leading her on while i'm still unsure. i don't think she senses it yet because i still try to be as intimate with her as i can, but sometimes it feels a little forced to be honest.  does anyone have any insights?  **TLDR: currently having great relationship with girlfriend, but having doubts and uncertainty for apparently no reason. anyone in the same position before can provide any advice or insights?**",r

We mostly see each other only on weekends because of work schedules, and also because he doesn't really want me to sleep over during the week as he says he doesn't sleep so well with me there and he needs a good night sleep to work. So really, it's more of a part-time relationship at this point.  I've been putting up with the fact that he doesn't really want me over anytime other than the weekends (I once tried surprising him, called him up and said I was coming over and cooking for him, he wasn't too excited...), which I must say has been a bit hard, but I figured he's been a bachelor for too long and needs time to adjust.   Now, today he straight-out admitted that if I ever move in (or we move in together), I would have to get my own separate room.  So, reddit, what do you think of the idea of couples having separate rooms? Would that kill or revive the romance? I can see the appeal in having my own space and everything, as I've always been fairly independant, but having separate bedrooms just seems kinda strange...   **TL;DR** : Boyfriend of 5 months admitted he'll never share a room.

You go and see it, and there’s about 5 guys standing around while the seller tries to show you the car. It’s already warmed up, and looking good. He takes you for a ride and nothing out of the ordinary shows, drives well, and then you drive it and everything goes well. You check everything just a few more times just to make sure, turn it off and on just to check the starter, battery and alternator. Looks good to you, so why not buy it?

l53g1,l53g1,therealgman,"So my g/f and I have been together for about 9 years, and I've always made more money than her, so naturally I pay for more than her, which I have no problem with. Now, though, I think it's getting out of hand, but I want to know if others agree.  So, we've lived together for years, and I pay the lions share of the rent and bills, she contributed what she could afford. Her contribution hasn't changed for years, and now what she pays covers about 15% of our rent and bills. On top of that, any furniture or goods we need, I buy, and any incidental stuff, like we need to hire a van for something, I pay for. She doesn't drive, so I do all the driving, which of course means the running of the car is all down to me. When we go out, I pay for everything, and on top of that she won't even go to the bar.  All of this is frustrating enough, but she has an expectation that we split household duties 50/50. That might sound reasonable, but that 50/50 does not include everything. Any DIY, or repairs, she ""can't do"" so I do it, and it therefore doesn't count as household duties. Same goes for: going to the shop for stuff we've run out of, actually paying any bills, taking rubbish out, humping furniture about, and so on. So it amounts to: there is laundry, and cooking, and cleaning that we can both do, and I'm expected to do half of that. Despite working 14 hour days to pay for all of this.   On top of that, she's doing absolutely nothing about finding a better-paid job. I'm a skilled professional, she isn't, and that's never going to change, which is fine, but she's quite happy to stay in a shitty job she doesn't even like, that pays crap, and is making no attempt to get out of it, yet is determined to live a lifestyle WAAAAAAAAAY beyond her means.

cc2smjh,1lmk8c,Lawrence_The_Lurker,So pretty much I just came to the conclusion that I really liked her but I HATED the fact that it was causing me to feel shit 27/4.

This turned the tables. Bitches want what they can't have and when they get it they don't want it anymore. If you seem unavailable you will seem more valuable (bit like gold hard to get). Shell miss your friendship and that will translate IN HER HEAD that she likes you.

Many attorneys offer free consultations and can give you an idea of how they would go about trying to resolve the matter, whether it's finding a potential breach or negotiating a release, etc.   Keep in mind the contract likely has a lot of fine print and legalese in there to protect the label, so this isn't really something you want to try and navigate on your own.

My parents know we're dating but I still rarely get to see her which leads to my next issue. The distance between us limits how frequently we get to see each other (I've only seen her twice before). We, however, make up for this by *constantly* talking on the phone every day after school and every night before we go to bed. I personally enjoy these calls but usually they are lacking. I ask her about her day, she asks me about mine, and we're limited on small talk after that point. I already know quite a bit about her so I don't know what to talk about with her. Honestly, as a teenager I live a very stressful life and not a lot goes on during my day. I go to school, come home, babysit, cook dinner and clean up everything all by myself since both my parents work. I rarely get time to myself or get to leave the house and go do fun stuff like a normal teen.

chd0w0d,250ez4,GinaBones,"Okay, this is kind of confusing me, and it seems like others as well, whether someone has to take a PBT BEFORE they are arrested, or their license will be suspended.  After reading only the first paragraph of the law(and not getting into the subsections of it), it would seem like one would have to submit to a PBT at the scene, after being pulled over(before being arrested).  &gt;343.305(2) (2) Implied consent. Any person who is on duty time with respect to a commercial motor vehicle or drives or operates a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state, or in those areas enumerated in s. 346.61, is deemed to have given consent to one or more tests of his or her breath, blood or urine, for the purpose of determining the presence or quantity in his or her blood or breath, of alcohol, controlled substances, controlled substance analogs or other drugs, or any combination of alcohol, controlled substances, controlled substance analogs and other drugs, when requested to do so by a law enforcement officer under sub. (3) (a) or (am) or when required to do so under sub. (3) (ar) or (b). Any such tests shall be administered upon the request of a law enforcement officer. The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall be prepared to administer, either at its agency or any other agency or facility, 2 of the 3 tests under sub. (3) (a), (am), or (ar), and may designate which of the tests shall be administered first.  http://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2011/343/343.305.html  But, if you read further down in the law, it states this:  &gt;343.305(3)(a) (a) Upon arrest of a person for violation of s. 346.63 (1), (2m) or (5) or a local ordinance in conformity therewith, or for a violation of s. 346.63 (2) or (6) or 940.25, or s. 940.09 where the offense involved the use of a vehicle, or upon arrest subsequent to a refusal under par. (ar), a law enforcement officer may request the person to provide one or more samples of his or her breath, blood or urine for the purpose specified under sub. (2). Compliance with a request for one type of sample does not bar a subsequent request for a different type of sample.  The two main words here are ""upon arrest."" So, if you have been arrested then by implied consent you do have to consent to the PBT and any other tests they want to administer.  Now, there is a subsection right under that(343.305(3)(am) ) saying that if you are driving a Commercial Motor Vehicle, for example a semi truck, then one would have to consent to a PBT(or any other tests) BEFORE one is arrested. But this only applies to CMV drivers, and not regular drivers.  There are also different laws about this if you were in an accident.  It even says this in the PDF that was posted earlier, under the ""Preliminary Breath Screening Test"" section:  &gt;""There is no penalty applicable to refusal to take a PBT.""  So, from all of this, it seems to me that one CAN refuse a PBT before being arrested, without fear of one's license being suspended. After arrest is when one has to comply.  Now, IANAL, so I do not know if refusing the PBT prior to arrest could actually give the cops evidence or probable cause to arrest you.   EDIT:  As a lay person(not a lawyer), if I were pulled over and I had been drinking(which I wouldn't do, but anyways), and they wanted to give me a PBT, I would probably refuse, especially if I thought I was just above the legal limit.  It takes time for the cop to get you to the station and to actually administer the test.  By the time I would finally get tested, I may well be under the limit.  Either way, I would still be arrested(taking the PBT before or after arrest), but by not being tested right away(where the blood alcohol level would be higher), I would have more of a fighting chance in that situation.  Now, if I hadn't been drinking at all, I would probably just take the test, so I won't have to waste my time being taken down to the police station.  Why waste all that time when you KNOW for a fact you will be let go?  It just wouldn't make sense.",l
hspft,hspft,,"So, I hooked up with this girl at my school this past week. We had been talking to each other a lot via text messgaing and at school. So I asked her if she wanted to go see one of the movies we were talking about. She says yes. We then deliberate how we are going to get there, when she asks me if she wants to go the beach instead. I asked her with who and she mentioned two people I do not generally like. In fact I had strong feelings about NOT going with thoes two people.   So I tell her I would rather not. She says that's fine and still wants to go to the movies. She asks her friend if he can drop us off at the movies and tells me that he was asking if it was a date or not. I replied by telling him to just take us. He decided against taking us.  The next day she proposes to go to the beach again. This time it is with her family though. I say sure why not.  The next day we go out with her family to the beach and we chill for a while. I did not really get to talk to her as much since her family was around. But when we did get to talk, it seemed like she wanted to distance herself from me. Although, the trip ended on a generally neutral note, not good not bad.

qptt8,qptt8,,"Gay guy here. So I live with my friend/ex (we broke up almost a year ago and I moved in with him at the end of last summer). We sleep in the same bed, but our relationship is basically roommate/friend-ish, not boyfriendish. (We haven't had sex since I got the clap from someone we had a threesome with at the beginning of December).   It's been almost a year since we broke up, but I'm beginning to think that I still haven't shaken the emotional need for him to be into me. I certainly don't love him in the naive way I did while we were dating, but I still care deeply for him and fear being supplanted.  Why I think this: We were going out for martinis last night, and when we were almost there he said he was going to be meeting someone he had been talking to online. I didn't know what to expect. I go to order a drink and when I get back they're sitting together and I had to introduce myself since J didn't. Strike one on making me the third wheel. J knowing full well that I didn't know anyone at the bar but him, proceeds to play a game of pool with the guy while I stare at the floor. We all smoke a cig outside, and they go on and on about cars and engines for 10 minutes while I stare at the floor. I eventually got up and left. Then they played another game inside.  The guy ended up giving us a lift back to our place, where we smoked and he bragged on and on about his dumb phone and the glowing keyboard on his stupid fucking alienware computer and totally excluded me from conversation. Eventually I just went to bed, and I could hear them fucking around on the couch and didn't get to sleep until J came back to bed, because it's hard to fall asleep without his body next to mine.  Basically, I was completely turned into a third wheel. While I (think I) respect the fact that we are NOT boyfriends anymore and that we can hook up with whoever we damn well want, I *definitely* didn't appreciate that he dragged me along to meet some trick of his, totally excluded me from everything that happened, and then fucked around with him while I listened. This being a guy who sleeps next to me every night and basically avoids any sort of sexual activity with me. I feel like something he hoarded because it does the dishes, but not because it's worth having fun or sex with. It scares me when he hooks up. I don't know what my role is. I simultaneously want to get as far away from him as possible (to give them space) and to win his affection/enjoyment/satisfaction. I also am terrified of him developing a relationship with someone and me having to move out because of it. I almost sound like someone who's in an abusive relationship, don't I? I hope I'm not the ""crazy"" they always warn against sticking your dick in. I fear that might be the case.  The guy came back over tonight. Currently they're looking at car stuff and I'm getting drunk upstairs. I tried to interact but they cut me out of the conversation so I left so I could be alone to get shitfaced drunk and hopefully forget about my feelings about the situation.  If you don't care about any of this bullshit emotional drama, don't comment. I mainly just wanted to get this off my chest since I don't really have any actual friends to vent to.  Thanks",r

Googling the collections company turns up a litany of complaints including some people saying they paid the money and the collections company turned around and kept billing them; others detailing typical scummy collections behavior.   With no plans to move to or visit WA state we're not terribly worried about the warrant but we'll keep it in mind. The little post card they sent requested information about employment, assets, bank accounts, etc. I feel like it was more of a fishing attempt by them to see if people are dumb enough to let them know about their finances. If they have the power to look all that up themselves why would they ask for it? Also, once they know about any assets would they have the power to come after them out of state?  I have figured this down to about two options:  1. completely ignore them, let the warrant sit on the books, avoid WA, and let the debt spiral to whatever amount for the remaining 5 years they have to collect it before the 10 year limit hits and it's void. Challenge whatever ding appears on her credit report. The risk here is if they have the power to dig up financial info and collect from out-of-state (thus the main reason I'm posting to /r/legal)  2. Attempt to settle with them. Write a letter offering a pittance amount per month due to hardship but offer to settle for roughly the original fine as long as they get any warrants off the books and do not report anything to credit. Risk here is that we are acknowledging the debt, and starting communication with them which might entice them to decline settlement and pursue further. Might be better to take this question over to /r/personalfinance at this point depending on legal risks.   Thoughts?",l

Well here are a few examples of how I would be overly needy; I had just started dating this one girl and I mentioned us moving in together lol, not so smooth...umm...also I would over-analyze matters (e.g. ""why hasnt she texted back!? its been 8 minutes!!"")..you get the picture.

I've been talking to her before and after every class, and we really seem to get along. I can't tell if it's because she's just naturally nice, or because she has interest in me. In the past week I've hung out with her a little after class a couple times and just stood and talked to her. Fast forward to Friday. I was listening to my iPod when she came into class, and she was curious as to what I was listening to. Apparently she loves the same band, and asked if I was going to their sold out show later this spring. I told her I didn't have tickets, and she brought up how she had an extra. Class started after that and we never really brought it up again.   I'm just trying to get an idea of what she thinks of me. Do any of you guys think there's actual interest from her? I, personally, can't stop thinking about her, but I don't want to do anything if I can't tell if she feels the same. Is it too early to make a move, or does her sort-of invitation to the concert show that there is something there?   Thanks guys.",r

oa3hv,oa3hv,,"So, first of, I'm not sure of that I want any advice here really. More feel like writing it, and hoping people will tell me what I want to hear.  Any how, to the story.  Last summer, in July, I met this amazing girl. I had previously been in a 4 year relationship, and was until meeting this girl stil in mourning. But as soon as I saw her I forgot all about my ex.   Not only does she look really good, but we have a lot of things in common, and she's the only girl I've met that can quote any Tarantino movie in her sleep.   So last summer a friends (who happes to be a girl) asks if she can bring this girl by, and I say that's perfectly fine. So I meet her, talk quite a bit to her, we go out dancing later that evening, we make out a lot on the dancefloor, we go swiming in the ocean in the morning, everything is perfect.   I soon realize that this is the first girl I've been with (made out with) that I actually wanted to be with, since my break up. All previous occations I had wished that the girls were my ex. But not this girl.  I tell our common friend this and she's exalted by it, partly for my sake, but also because she says she thinks we'd be great together.   So we keep seeing each other, and sometimes we make out. And one day I tell her that I think I'm kind of in love with her. She does not respond well.   She rather explains that she really likes me, but does not see us as more than friends.  Next weekend she ends up in my bed. We make out, get undressed, but when we are naked she pulls the handbrake and says that she can't have sex with me because it wouldn't be fair to me.   Fair enough I think. She then starts teling me a lot of intimate secrets, about how she recently lost her virginity to a friend (she was/is 22, the same as me btw) and then asks why she would even tell me this.   Things go on as they had been all the time. We see each other a few times, just her and me, eating and watching movies etc. Something that could in all honesty be seen as both a date or just hanging out with a friend. She keeps telling me that we are just friends. She wants to make sure that I know that, and whenever I insinuate that I think she likes me too, as she is after all very intimate with me, she denies it at first, but then moves on to flirting.   So things have been like this all fall, until, last weekend, she ended up in my bed again. And just like always she stops me right before having sex.   But this time I tell her that if she doesn't want to hurt my feelings, perhaps she should have never even ended up in my bed to begin with. Being naked in the bed with a woman I care for, making out, but being told that I can't handle the sex emotionally is just frustrating.   So we end up having sex.   The next day we spend all day in bed, talking, having more sex and enjoying life. She tells me that I was her third, the second had been a firefighter in Vegas that she can't even remember the name of, and her first was her friend.   She then tells me that she is in love with another friend of hers.   And we lay there talking. And then she tells me that she does not like this other friend. She tells me that he is a bad influence, but she can't shake the need of being close to him. She says she wished that she felt the same way for me, as I was the kind of guy she wanted to fall in love with.   Later that evening she also says that she was a bit worried about my tenderness towards her. She said she thinks I'm too loving in some kind of way.   And then she went home, and we keept talking. We've talked every day since, even though we haven't met.   But I'm not sure I can go on like this.   I was perfectly fine with us being ""friends""... or what I thought we were. But now I find out that she's in love with one of her best friends. It became apparent that I've just been lucky not to see them together, as they are apparently spending a lof of time together.   So now, what I want to hear is that she loves me, but she wont realize it until I stop seeing her for a while. Because that's probably what I plan to do.   What I'll probably hear is that she does not love me, that she'll never end up with me, we were just friends with some kind of benefits all along. Never more, even though I wanted more.",r

c5rfwmg,xpu7o,kawanami,"It sounds like you need some you-time. Id say the ultimate balance in any relationship is feeling empowered while being with a significant other, hence the ""need to be free"". You need to feel okay being by your self.

I never used to be like this. Bt after living with her for almost 2 years, i think ive changed alot.  A few months after we strarted living together, things started to change. She started to become messy and strted being something like a spoiled brat. She woiuld throw tantrums everytime she wouldnt get waht she wanted. At first i thought it was cute but then things started getting worse. Now almost everyday we start arguing over something.   Today started normally enough. I was asleep and she started waking me up to take her brother to school. I was tired and didnt want to wake up so i told her no. She started nudging me and talking loudly trying to get me awake. She told me to get off her bed (we share) and go to the couch if i wasnt going to take her brother. So i moved to the couch and she relented. When she came back, she apologized and said sorry. Here was my big mistake. I told her no your not because you always do this and she got mad. She turned on the tv really loud and strtd taking up space in the couch. I asked her nicely to please turn it off because i was still sleeping (i work late in the night so my sleep schedule is kind of messed up) and i had work later in the afternoon. She then started saying that she wanted to watch tv and thats wht she always does during the day and that i should know that. ( she doesnt work). After i asked her a couple more times i juset snapped. This is very uncharacteristic for me. I started screaming at her from the top of my lungs. I started throwing pillows at her and she told me to get out. Now, i signed a lease with her so its not like i could just leave. I have nowhere else to go and ive since alienated all my friends for her. When she told me to leave for the second time i went and slapped her.mshe startd crying and i felt like shit.   Everytime we fight she tells me to move out. I have nowhere else to go. My family is in a different country. Her family leaves 2 hours away. It isnt fair. I work to pay the bills and rent and she relies on her parents to pay her half of the rent. She treats me like shit all the time and ive wante to leave since forever but like i said, im on a lease. I cant afford to find another place to stay. I do want to leave because i dont want to do anything like that again.... Any advice?",r
dt97hpv,7t1ll5,Shillyshelly,"NAL  The police officer gave you a verbal warning, the only record of that, if any, would be in his notes, which are not part of public record.  Additionally, in Canada, there are three levels of background checks.   Most employers only run a criminal background check which, like in most commonwealth countries, only reveals convictions, and absolute and conditional discharges within particular time frames.  A more thorough Police Information Check (PIC) can reveal records of interactions with police (but not details). PIC’s are not common in the course of normal employment, as employers must show the check is a reasonable condition for a specific position, so unless you are applying for a sensitive position in a sensitive sector like government, finance etc, it’s generally not a concern.

ngqlp,ngqlp,longshotinthedark,"So, figured I'd come here as I don't have anywhere else to go with this.  My boyfriend is going crazy I think and I'm not sure what to do.  If it was just me, I'd pick up and move somewhere else, but we have a toddler together so that makes everything more complicated.     The Story:  This is going to be a long story but hear me out.  About six months ago tf2 went free to play and at the urging of friends, I tried it out.  I didn't expect to like it, all my previous video game experience had been with single player rpgs, but to my surprise I did.  I picked it up relatively quickly and became good enough for a clan.  This was about 3 months in when I had put 250 hours into the game.  I probably fell in love with this game because as a mother and a student I wasn't able to leave my apartment much.  I spent a lot of nights just watching tv or reading books or doing homework.  I have friends, but I wasn't really able to go to their parties or drop everything and go shopping.  Anyway, around this time my boyfriend starting fighting with me over really mundane things and then one night, he completely lost it.  He said I loved my game more than him and started banging his head on the wall, then he told me it was over, packed his stuff and left.  He called his mother (who then called me: really awkward), he called my mom, he called everyone and told them he was breaking up with me.  Eventually though, he calmed down and begged me to take him back, which I did.  I explained that I was really surprised he was hurt by me playing games.  We still went out, and did things together, its just that instead of me reading a book and watching him play fallout or Call of Duty, now I was playing games too.  He had spent hour after hour every night playing games for as long as I could remember.  The week I gave birth to our toddler, he spent it trying to unlock Super Smash Bro's Brawl characters.  He admitted he was being unfair and dropped it... or so I thought.  The whole, freak out, get really angry, break up with me, call everyone scenario repeated itself three more times.  Each time I took him back.  After the fourth time, I told him because he was having such a hard time with me playing games that I would only play two hours a day.  This made things better for a little while but then he started getting angry any time I play tf2.  And just tf2 mind you.  I would leave off it for several days, play other games, like mass effect or something, and he would be perfectly happy.  The second I started playing tf2 he'd give me the silent treatment, take away the car keys, hide my ipod, password his computer, refuse to pick up groceries (he works next to a grocery story).  He'd tell me he'd give me a ride to school, then refuse at the last minute so I'd be late for class.  Eventually he just exploded at me and accused me of cheating on him with the guys I play tf2 with.  He already had all my passwords, watched all my instant message conversations and saw that I mostly discussed weapon updates, but this was not enough.  He also accused me of cheating on him with my autistic friend, my TA, and just about every male in my life.    I've played tf2 less and less, leaving it off for days and weeks at a time, but any time I pick it up again he becomes crazy.  Last night I played, first he was faux happy, then angry, then he got really sad and started crying, then got angry again.  He told me I wanted him to die, and told me his death would solve a lot of problems.  He left in the middle of the night, drove around for hours, came back sobbing and hugging me and trying to reconcile.  But I woke up this morning and he's still angry.  He refuses to seek help, psychological or any other medical help, though I have begged and begged.  He yells at our toddler and scares her.  She doesn't want to be around him anymore, and keeps crying ""Daddy is always mad at me.""  His talk of death is scaring me, and he is getting more violent with his arguments, throwing things and swearing at me.  I'm afraid that if I leave him I will face a law suit from his parents (who have quite a bit of money and sue anyone at the drop of a hat) and that he will hurt our toddler in his anger if I'm not around (I'm assuming we would have joint custody, or because of his parent's lawyers, he would be granted full custody).

1wj0sn,1wj0sn,Throwaway123cake,"So I've been in a relationship with my bf for two years now and have a child together. During those two years, we've been through a mess of shit. (Homelessness, going hungry, sleeping in the cold ect) however, even if things got bad, we still stuck it out together and eventually got a place.   Before we finally got a place, I got pregnant. During my pregnancy, bf and I stayed together with family and friends gathering the money for our home and our child. However, I lost my job and a lot of the weight fell on him. With my hormones a mess, I'll admit, I wasn't as understanding with him and the amount of stress I put him under. While we were at his family's house, they would constantly bring up the fact that I wasn't working, the kid wasn't his (which it is) I'm a slut, I can't cook, and a lot of harassment from all of his brothers and his mother. I couldn't handle it and it strained our relationship a lot, since he would listen to his family rather then me. I left his family's house and got an apartment with my mother (with my money). I broke up with him because I was under a lot of stress, very hurt that he didn't stick up for me and the fact that our child was coming and we still haven't buckled down for our own place. 8 months into my pregnancy, I'm living alone in my apartment about to give birth any day now. He would call me and he'd come over ""talk about it"" (we would have sex), take whatever money I had and leave because he would say he will be back with his things. This happened for months well into my giving birth.  When our child was born, he was with me at the hospital and helped me throughout labor and I thought that he would finally move in now that our son was born. Two months pass with the same type of behavior from him, very passive, secretive, and angry at me. He would stay a few days and then leave and I wouldn't hear from him for days. Since I was bored, lonely and also had an adorable baby, I got really into Instagram and posting tons of pictures of my baby and sharing them with family and friends. Then I posted a picture of my bf.  A family member pointed out to me that he looked familiar to her. Then I start to notice that her Instagram had a whole bunch of pictures of a pregnant friend of hers. Curiously I went on this girl's page and found out that she was dating my bf. I asked family member what was going on and she pretty much knew the whole time and didn't bother to tell me because she doesn't like me.  I confronted my bf and he told me that he was dating her, but isn't with her anymore. I ask about the baby and e said at not his, however, I hear otherwise. he still leaves without me knowing when he's coming back and so I got nosy and looked though his emails, social sites ect. Turns out he was still talking and dating her, telling her that he's not in a relationship with me, I have child support on him and I'm not letting him see his kid (all of which were lies.) and that he was not going to spend Christmas with me but with her. Meanwhile, he's living with me, eating my food, wasting electricity. I was so pissed that I punched him in the face, packed up his shit threw him out and left to spend Christmas with my dad. I came back the next day and he begs and begs to be with me and after a lot of begging, and much to my disappointment, I let him in, with one condition.  He and I will confront her and talk about our sons and how we plan to play it out.He got angry and defensive with me telling me it wasn't my place. I didn't care and I still went to speak to her. He was too scared to speak to her with me so I alone spoke to her face to face.  She told me that they broke up a week prior to me speaking to her and that she wasn't sure if she was going to keep her son. I didn't get involved with her choice and I wasn't mean or rude. I told her what was going on with me and my bf and that I understand that it wasn't her fault to be mixed up in this mess, but it would be nice if our sons were on good terms and not strangers to each other. I told her that my bf said it wasn't his, but she neither denied or confirmed. He then speaks to her later and I get an email thanking me for speaking to her and telling her the truth. He broke up with her and now wants to change for the good.  He's given me all his passwords and such and has been on ""good behavior"". So far he's actually be trying to gain my trust, so much so that we have talked about therapy, and our future plans.  But my trust was broken and I don't trust him as far as I can throw him. Even though we've been through so much together, this one mistake has gotten me into a depression and I spaz out every time I get suspicious of him. I look though his emails and still see that girl messaging him (I miss you, please talk to me,) but he doesn't message back and I'm getting passive emails from her to the point where she's very competitive about my bf.   I see that he's trying very hard to gain my trust but I'm so hurt and convinced hes lying to me every chance that he gets. I also get suspicious of this girl constantly messaging me and him even though she said she would back off.   I want to dump him but we have a very long history together (we grew up together prior to dating) and have a child. Do I try to make this work for the sake of our family? Can I  trust him? I don't want to deal with this problem because I want to focus on my life and not a love triangle.  I'm not too sure what to do. I love him a lot an know him well. I want to see our relationship grow like it was prior to living with his family and I see him trying very hard to gain my trust, he's spending him with me and my family, made his family apologize for their comments, he's a great father and is going to school for the future of our family.   I'm so confused what can I do?",r

e0boxmk,8pfoxp,NanoRaptoro,"""To me it sounds like they should have removed it early on""  This is why you should definitely get a second opinion (from a specialist if possible). Generally, they wait until farther along in pregnancy to do most prenatal surgeries. It could be that if you had surgery to remove it earlier you would have potentially lost both babies. Or maybe it would have been safer; only a different doctor can tell you. Once you have a second opinion (and possibly a third; if the second opinion contradicts the first, I would get another), the take it to medical malpractice attorney. They will know if you have a case. There is not an enormous rush to talk to a lawyer, as that should not influence your medical care (and also you will not know about all possible damages you might have until you pregnancy is over and your future reproductive health/ the health of your children can be evaluated.  (Also, you'd think that having an IUD fall out would be impossible, but from what I've read, that is actually the main way they ""fail.""

We are both really into each other and are generally pretty happy with the relationship in general.  However, he told me pretty early on that he suffers from depression.  Before now, things have seemed alright sometimes he will get a little down but overall not to bad. Starting maybe a few weeks ago and getting progressively worse, he has been getting more down on himself and his life in general.  He's not happy with his job, current living arrangements and other small factors.  I haven't seen him this down before, and he was basically going on today about just not giving a fuck anymore and how nothing mattered and he was just going to stop trying at everything.    So, my question is,  what is the best way to handle this?  I care about him deeply, but sometimes I find it very difficult to be sympathetic because I feel like he is overreacting and taking things too personally.  It doesn't help that when I try to be reassuring and I try to give him suggestions to fix his problems, all he does is shoot down my suggestions and continue to sulk.

c1br6e6,exnan,GoForTheRebound,"26-year-old female here. Not quite as late a bloomer, but I was pretty sheltered, having had nothing but 2 five-year relationships to go off of. No dating, no experimenting, no nothing. From zero to 10 years of seriousness.  The second guy broke up with me a year ago. It nearly killed me (and no, I'm not speaking figuratively). After the first few months' worth of intense pain had begun to dull, I realized that I had absolutely no idea how to move on, find guys, date, anything. My two relationships had fallen in my lap without me looking. I felt like such a... well, such a *noob*.  On a friend's urging, I joined OkCupid and spent a couple of months sifting through the ten or so emails I got each day, trying to find a nice guy and at the same time gathering the courage to meet any of them in person. After a few weeks, I swallowed my fears and went on a date.  That first date turned into a cool friendship. The next date did nothing for either party. However, the third date turned into my first actual rebound.  I may get a lot of flak for saying this, but that really boosted my self-esteem. After that, I wasn't as scared to put myself out there -- go on dates with guys from school, or with friends' friends. Some might consider it to have been an embarrassingly provocative summer, but it really helped me out. I came out of September with more self-confidence that I'd ever had before. And I think it's truly had a thoroughly positive effect on my new relationship.  The issue of him being your best friend is another story, but I personally think that you'd always wonder if you don't give it a try.  TL;DR: Go for it. It's worth the risk.",r

Previously if a female walked by, she would accuse me of ""looking at her"", or when we would go to the mall she would constantly look at me to see if i was looking at someone.

I was accused of encouraging this female to be too friendly and my wife called this female every name in the book.

My high school sweetheart.""*  My initial reaction was 'yeah, I see where she's coming from', but then I realized that she over-dramatizing the whole thing *so much* that I almost couldn't believe that she actually sent this.  It's almost as if I'm in a TV show sometimes. It's so stupid and unnecessary.  Can anybody give me some advice?",r

1k5nux,1k5nux,NorthDakota,"Hello.  I'm am a 25 y/o male, gf is 24.  My background - I never graduated, I dropped out in my last week of college due to circumstances that I couldn't avoid.  At this point I was already dating my current gf.  The next few years were rocky for me emotionally, I struggled with depression, moved from part time job to part time job, and obviously wasn't the most grown-up person in the world.  gf's background - still in school, graduating this year.  She took a few semesters off here and there, and worked between serving jobs over the years as well.  She struggles with some mental health issues such as depression/anxiety/panic attacks.  Quick relationship breakdown - We are really great together.  I love her so much and she loves me.  We've really been through it all together and she's always been there for me.  We've been on and off a few times, but when we started dating we already lived together with another person so it was difficult to stay separated.  We also weren't the strongest people emotionally.  Recent ""worst"" breakup - This May, I had had it.  It was over for me.  She constantly disrespected me and my friends, would say she didn't like the people I worked with, wouldn't go places with me.  We had moved in together in January when things were going well because we lived so far apart and driving that far every day, plus the extra incentive of paying less rent seemed really appealing.  But she was constantly sad and angry, having frequent panic attacks, and she took a lot out on me.  I wanted to continue being her personal cheer leader, telling her I'd help her however she needed, offering to call a doctor or therapist, telling her to talk with her family, trying to be supportive but it was not working.  We sat down on may 10 and both said we were unhappy.  The next day she says she's willing to do whatever it takes to keep it together, she will call the doctor, give her 7 days.  7 days rolls around, nothing happened, I move out into my own place and break it off completely.  When I say completely, in my mind I was thinking I can't ever talk to her again or at least not for a long time.    Well, July 15th we sit down and talk again and she's like a different person.  She's lost 20 lbs, regular sees her therapist and is on regular medication.  She's got new friends and we start hanging out as friends.  I am also down over 25 lbs and applied for school this next semester, and my personal life is going much better.  I run 6 miles a day and eat well and feel as good as I've ever felt since the break up.  Over time we both realize it's going really well now, and decide to get back together officially.  So last week she tells me after we had gotten back together she slept with someone else.  A random person out one night when she was drinking.  Excuse was drinking, and that everyone was constantly telling her not to get back together with me, including her family (who she still hasn't told that we are back together), and that he was nice and paid attention to her.  I don't know what to do.  **tl;dr: 3 year relationship ended in may, got back together in july after both of us had changed our lives, gf slept with someone else after that point.  I don't know what to do.**",r

raul1,raul1,works_in_cafes,"Reddit, help me stop being such a douchebag.  I'm posting this because I've been agonizing over it for months, if not years.  It's not a ""major issue"", not a ""big story"", it's not especially interesting or heartbreaking or important in any way.  But I need help, because I don't know what to do with myself.  It also requires a little bit of background for my personality and my relationship, so I hope you'll have the patience to read everything.  My girlfriend and I will be graduating from the same college at the end of this year.  We have been dating since freshman year, but I have known her since middle school.  She had been sexually precocious and had sex with a handful of guys before *I lost my virginity to her*.  I had never been in a relationship before, and had never gotten past first base.  In fact, for most of my youth I was sort of an ugly duckling.  I was short, had a couple of pudgy periods, and was pretty awkward (I remain somewhat so).  During the first year or so of our relationship, my girlfriend--let's call her Lisa--and I had an open relationship.  She had sex with one person during this time, whereas I didn't move past first base with anyone.  I was still uncomfortable with sex, but what's important about this period is that girls began to really like me.  That is, I was a pimp in the eighth-grade sense, except I was a freshman in college.  As it turns out, I'm kind of good-looking and can occasionally be charming.  This phenomenon has only worsened (or bettered) over time.  Lisa and I have been exclusive for more than two years, and during that time I've turned down or snubbed more girls than I can count on both hands--pretty girls, too, even a model or two.  I'm not a cheater, and I never will be.  Lisa is amazing.  She is beautiful, talented, adorable in the best sense.  We like to hole up together and eat cake and watch movies.  And I love her, I honestly do.  But I have problems.  The first is that Lisa and I don't have great conversations very often.  I don't know if a relationship like that is sustainable, but I find that we're at our best when we're by ourselves watching TV--we just don't talk that well, and I don't know if she knows that.  When we're in groups of people, I almost always interact with others and not with her; I need some kind of intellectual stimulation, and she doesn't provide it all that well.  The second, and pressing, problem is me, all me.  I think about other women constantly.  Women take up the single biggest portion of my consciousness.  I love women.  This has been a gradual transformation probably correlated with my increasing appeal to the opposite sex, but then again I really don't know how accurate my conception of that appeal is.  Regardless, I think about women all day.  I jerk off constantly.  I make pretty female friends just to have them around.  I would not describe this situation as one of ""temptation""--girls don't really make moves on me, as such, and, as I said earlier, I'm not a cheater.  If I was going to do it, I probably would have done it by now.  But with graduation approaching and no set plans for the future, I don't know where this relationship is going.  Lisa makes me incredibly happy, and we hardly ever fight, but when I think about the passage of time, I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I have had sex with only one person, have been in love with only one person, have dated really only one person.  I know that if I break up with Lisa I'll probably be fine, but it has always struck me as particularly silly to end a perfectly good relationship so as to have a chance to ""play the field.""  I'm also struck by the particularly superficial and selfish fear that I'll break up with her and then will be suddenly unattractive to the opposite sex.  So that's what I've got.  It's not much of a problem, but it's on my plate and I need advice.  Do your worst.",r

4cgtis,4cgtis,stevejoe123,"Ok, so im an 18 year old full time student with a part time job. In late January of this year I received a speeding ticket during the prohibitory period of my license (first 6 months of license in New York State). My license was suspended for 60 days so I applied for a restricted use license and received one. This license allows me to go to school and back as well as work and back. During this prohibitory period I went to get food from a fast food restaurant after attending class. This restaurant was not directly in the path back to my house but also not very far off. On my way pulling out of the parking lot of this restaurant i was making a left hand turn onto a 5 lane street (two lanes north, two lanes south, one turning lane in middle). All the lanes were clear and i began to pull out. As i rolled forward a cyclist came out in front of me riding in the opposite direction of traffic (heading north in the southbound side). What's the best case scenario here for me? Also I received a ticket for operating a restricted use license outside of the restrictions. Should i claim guilty or not guilty?

jbv5s,jbv5s,sexuallyfrustratedbf,"I am in situation right now where this is happening and I don't know what to do. Here is the back story:  We have dated for about two years and for the first year and a half we had sex quite often and it was very enjoyable. She seemed to enjoy it as well but there were some points where it was difficult to get her to orgasm or she would have absolutely no interest in doing so. Additionally, sometimes (due to physical differences between us) she would get hurt (not seriously, just experience pain that didn't persist long). As we got further into the relationship we were both busy and didn't have as many opportunities to have sexual relations, which made these differences worse because we were not having sex often.  I always always always want her to be pleased during sex but it became more and more ""I will just please you"" from her. Now, because we have had jobs for the summer during college we haven't seen one another in about 3.5 months. Obviously, I have masturbated quite a bit and she has as well (she says she has) but never over ooVoo with one another (we had often done this during vacations).  Since school is starting in 4 weeks I texted her something about how I really missed all aspects of our relationship and if we had the opportunity I would enjoy settings up a sexual webcam date. She wasn't interested and she was kind of aloof after I asked. So I followed up with ""are you even interested in me sexually?"" and she said no and that she was sorry, and she wasn't interested in anyone else either. She just wants to have a non-sexual relationship.  I am sad because I have only had two relationships and sex was (until now) a part of the relationship that I always enjoyed that really complimented all the other things we enjoyed doing together.  Have you ever been in this situation? If you were, what would you do?  TLDR: Girlfriend isn't into me sexually anymore and just wants to maintain a non-sexual relationship Thanks Reddit!",r

1lraop,1lraop,,"I'm 16, and I have no clue how to tell her( my bestfriend/ex girlfriend ) that I'm gay. First off we dated for two years and known eachother for 3. And I'm her second boyfriend and the first boyfriend was a HUGE piece of shit and he turned out to be gay so she doesn't count him as her first boyfriend (since it was based on a lie) .  Because of him she has low self esteem she hates herself and if I told her I was gay she would think that no straight guy would ever actually like her because she hasn't been with a straight guy. What makes it worse is that her and I have had alot of sex so it will be harder for her to believe me and she will also be so hurt.  But we just slept together because 1.) I was trying to avoid being gay and denying myself  2.) Trying to act straight as to not arrouse suspicion 3.) I'm a hormonal teen who had the opportunity to have alot of sex, of course I took it. I regret it now.  I have tried to tell her before but she refused to believe me and thought I was trying to get a rise out of her so after a couple minutes I backed out and said I was only kidding and then we fooled around.....

Essentially, I have been dating the same woman for the past 3 years and everything is amazing. She is smart, funny, and sexy. Total package. EXCEPT for one key thing; sometimes she wont defend me.  Example. Last Night I stayed over at a mutual friends house that my girlfriend is renting a room from. Our mutual friend (that has known my GF longer, they grew up together) essentially asked my GF to tell me that she doesn't want me around the house during the afternoon, like she just thinks its ""weird"".

What pissed me off the most was that my Girlfriend in no way, shape or form, defended me. AT ALL. Which to me is just fucking mind-boggling. If my roomate told me he didnt want my GF around the house all day I would have kindly told him to fuck off I pay rent and I have rights and if he does'nt like it he can go fuck himself and the horse he rode in on.

8koc5v,8koc5v,businessthrowaway001,"Hello, I am trying to start and LLC and was wondering a few things. I don't have an online business right now, but I have all the necessary tools and startup materials needed for the business in which I want to get into. I really don't want to procrastinate any longer with starting the actual business, but I don't know all of the rules about the money made with the company before it's an actual LLC and if I have to report that money on a different tax form or not than the money I would with my company after I have registered it as an LLC. I guess the only thing I am afraid of starting my business now instead of when all the paperwork is filed and it is officially an LLC, I don't know if my business would be negatively impacted if I start now as opposed to waiting until it is formally and officially an LLC. I was also thinking that this LLC would be a ""parent"" company to my online stores. I expect to open niche stores in Ebay and Amazon, but under different names that would make more sense for the specific niche I am trying to get into. I do want to have my own website as well with my LLC's name \(which is just a general name, not really a name of a business for any specific niche\). How does that work on sites like Amazon and Ebay regarding if those online stores under different names can still be a part of my ""parent"" LLC? I guess what I am trying to ask is, do my Amazon and Ebay stores have to be the same exact name as the name of the LLC I register or can it be different names? I guess, is there any formal or official thing that I need to do to connect my Amazon and Ebay stores \(who have different names than the name of my LLC\)...or is it just something that if I say that these online stores are a part of my LLC, then that makes it so? I know that tax law and business law are complex and there are vast amounts of gray area, but I want to do everything correctly and the first step to doing that is knowing exactly what I can and can't do regarding my LLC \(and companies that fall under the ""umbrella"" of my LLC\). Would I have to register each different name of my Ebay and Amazon stores as it's own LLC? Or can I just claim that that store is under the ""umbrella"" of my LLC? Thank you in advance! \[IL\]",l

I would cover my arse by getting strong chaps to hold the door open, but it first just be YOU going inside, then the second you wriggle inside, call the others in as your guests. If they go in first I imagine K might call the cops and claim breaking &amp; entering or trespassing or something (not sure if trespassing is a civil or criminal matter in your jurisdiction). Whereas you have every right to enter, and thereafter you're inviting friends to join you in your private room.  See programmes about the work of bailiffs to watch how quickly and firmly the doorstep is done - in the UK ""Can't pay? We'll take it away"" is good for this, if it's available online.  Re: locksmith - can't you just get bro to bring an electric drill? Drill the lock, then once inside get it replaced and issue K and landlord a key. But only do this if K is out, else she could bolt the door from the inside. Do you have a back door that's easier to enter? Or a window that's often kept ajar?  Once you're in, post again and hopefully people can then advise where to go next, re landlord, lease, and expenses; also re K, your property and your safety.   You need to get back in promptly: since K already interviewed prospective roommates, she's probably intending to sub-let your room ASAP. If that's the case, remember it's YOUR room which you have paid for; check your lease, but I'm pretty sure subletting would be prohibited, and of course there'd be the issue of two lots of money paid out for the same room. Either way, K has no right to do this, it's YOUR room, stand your ground. I hope your room is intact and has no unwelcome guests, but it's something to prepare for just in case. Another good reason not to re-enter alone.",l

cvul054,3nt3m7,jedrekk,"Here in Poland, there are legally defined jobs where employers are allowed to require a certificate of *niekaralność* (literally: one who hasn't been punished). These include school teachers, lawyers, judges, people oversee bankrupt companies, security guards, etc. Such certs cost about 12€ and are processed while you wait at the government office or via the mail.  For all other jobs, if you're asked for a certificate and refuse, you can sue for discrimination if you don't get the job. Now, you'll need to prove that your refusal to deliver the certificate was the reason you didn't get the job, but depending on how sympathetic the judge is to the cause of the working man, your proof doesn't need to be very strong. In my experience, having worked some 5 jobs over the past 16 years, nobody's asked for anything ever.",l

1bwnj9,1bwnj9,seoneill89,"Ok, so here's an overview of what happened to get where I am now.. (taken out addresses for privacy)   In the month of March 2012 I was involved in a verbally abusive incident with an employee of Nexus Passenger Transport Executives when I was caught traveling without having purchased a ticket. My contact details were then recorded and a penalty fine of £20 was assessed and presented to me on the spot. The following week I visited Monument Metro station to present an apology for my inappropriate conduct. The employee involved in the incident accepted my apology and counseled me to contact legal services to further explain myself, although did not make me aware I was being fined for use of abusive language on the metro. I attempted to call the Nexus legal team but was unable to reach anyone. I unfortunately did not pursue the matter further.  I remained in Sunderland at______ through the end of June until my course of study at the University ended.   After residing with my Mother's partner for a short period of time at ________, I then traveled abroad in July for several months and have since taken up residence in Berlin at ________. I did not receive any communication whatsoever in respect to this matter at either my former Sunderland address, or c/o the University of Sunderland where I was enrolled as a full time student, or at my mother's residence in Guildford or c/o another Guildford acquaintance, _________ at whose home a Bailiff appeared on 4/4/2013 with a final notice of payment. As best I can understand it appears that a judgement has been entered against me requiring payment of £735 as a fine for the March 2012 incident. I have no funds to pay such a fine and believe it should be reduced or revoked  as I was unable to address the issue out of a complete lack of knowledge of the case.  In some initial research it looks as though I need to apply for a stay of execution to get the bailiff off of Mother's partners back. I'm not sure if the Bailiff could take things from him, because I do not live at the residence, all I do is get mail sent there... Does anybody know?  Any help/knowledge of what to do would be so great. Do I have a chance of actually getting the fee reduced?? Is it worth taking to court? Or do the Bailiffs have all the say now???",l

I can fully empathize with your SO; I too have severe chronic depression that's difficult to manage due to its severity, and I too find that I have a more limited number of useful hours in a day than most people do. I'll have a week here and there where all I want to do is sleep.  However, I also *plan* things with my SO. We went to Vegas for a week this month, and I spent the week before getting as much sleep as possible so that I could be ready to adhere to a normal (read: rigorous) vacation schedule while we were there. Crowds, too, tire me out extremely quickly, so my SO knows that he can't usually spring a party invitation on me at the last minute; but because he's aware of this, he makes sure to tell me in advance, which gives me the time I need to physically and mentally prepare for the drain on my energy stores.  It's all give and take. She doesn't sound like she's putting enough effort into this. Depression is hard, yeah; believe me, I know. It takes all you have and demands more, and getting out of bed most days seems like an insurmountable, herculean task.

Usually this is the reason for companies having company cars for their employees to use on official business.  You do not have a Michigan No-Fault policy, nor were you required to since you were just visiting, briefly.  You're right about the meaning of that term, your damage is between you and your insurance company, whether you were at fault or not.  There is an option to buy insurance policies that allow for deductibles to be waived if the insurance company assesses you to not be at fault but that is an optional add-on to the minimum policy.  There is a ""mini-tort"" provision in the statute that allows for a small claims action to recover for vehicle damage, up to $1000.  It would be up to you (or possibly your company) to bring that claim in a Michigan court, the district court closest to where the other vehicle's owner lives.  You can only recover damages related to the damage to the vehicle, not for any injuries you may have suffered.  That can be a frustrating ordeal, however.  The other important thing to remember for you, is that besides the mini-tort, you cannot sue the Michigan driver (assuming he or she was covered by a Michigan No-Fault policy).  Having that type of policy immunizes you from suit except in certain circumstances, none of which you fit into.      Tl;dr:  Your employer may cover this.  You may be able to recover the deductible but will have to travel to Michigan several times in order to do so.",l

c2ax7we,ivnsp,SmoSays,"The offer doesn't have an expiration date! I'm happy to do it. I will comment on each part first and at the end give an overall opinion. ~~~AAnything crossed out is something that can be, well, taken out.~~ Check that. If I cross out anything it fucks everything up. So I'll just edit that stuff out and you can compare it to the original. Bold is something added, italicized means it was changed (either spelling or grammar).   &gt; The word professional is ~~typically ~~used to describe an expert on a particular subject.   It seems almost as if you're going somewhere with this then you don't. I almost feel that after this you had a great deal more to say then edited it out. It seems to stand out from the rest of the essay. I don't think you should get rid of it entirely; add on to it. Help it transition into the next sentence. I crossed out 'typically' because with it in I got the feeling you were about to explain why the typical definition isn't the right one. SUGGESTION: The wording is a bit bulky and awkward. Try saying it out loud - I don't know if this is going to be a speech but sounding it out will help identify unnatural phrasing. Think of a speech by a congressman. Now compare it to a monologue by a stand-up comedian. Both were written down before they were presented, but the latter sounds more natural. My suggestion is not to distance yourself from it. Instead of giving the textbook definition of the word, why not give your own? OH and also remove 'on a particular subject'. It isn't important to the essay. Reddit wouldn't let me strike it out for some reason.   &gt; Characteristics associated with professionals are *diligence, compassion*, and **a sense of** *responsibility*. These characteristics are ~~also~~ ones I try to reflect in my own person.  To repeat earlier, try inserting yourself into this. What do you think are three things needed to become a professional? The rewording will help blend with the first sentence. I would also leave the word 'characteristics' out of one of these places. Repetition causes the reader to lose interest. You can just say 'I feel that a true professional would be compassionate, etc. etc.'   &gt; As a child, I was sickly, frail and faced a great deal of bullying. From kindergarten to middle school I was often harassed and treated as a pariah. Oscar Wilde once said, “some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.” Due to my childhood experiences, I have always vowed to be the foremost.   Now this is a wonderful start. Sickly and frail? I'm fucking intrigued! This is also what I was talking about: making it personal. GOOD ON YOU. I removed two commas since they were unnecessary and I have three suggestions. SUGGESTION 1. What? You kind of started an interesting story and then went another way. Why did it stop in middle school? What happened; was it Mrs. White in the kitchen with the candlestick? How did you overcome it and how did it translate to that mantra? Remember: your readers aren't in your head so you're going to have to spell it out for them. SUGGESTION 2. It might flow a little better to put the Oscar Wilde sentence at the head of the paragraph. Then replace the 'Due to my childhood experiences' with the explanation on what about your experiences made you vow to be the one to cause happiness wherever you go? SUGGESTION 3. Foremost what? Or did you meant former?   &gt; Whether it’s comforting a homeless veteran on the bus or *beaming* **at** every customer **who** walks through the pharmacy, I want to positively influence everyone’s mood. *R*egardless of social economic status everyone wants **to know** someone care**s**. I try to be compassionate towards everyone I meet because **it is** how I would like to be treated.  Mostly grammar changes here. Trimming the fat so to speak. Starting a sentence with 'thus' or 'because' or 'therefore' doesn't break any grammar rules but it is generally frowned upon with college essays. Only issue is at the end. Compassionate seems like a buzzword here and even though it is a college paper, it is okay to use a slightly more casual phrasing. Other than that I think this chunk is perfect and reflects your passion on the subject. MORE PERSONAL though.   &gt; Diligence is also an important attribute ~~for~~ of a professional because a hastily done job can be more harmful than beneficial.   This is a bit . . . stiff. I would suggest rephrasing it to something like 'Because a hastily done job can be more harmful than beneficial, diligence is an important attribute of a professional'. This is a good point. Working around machines, if something isn't done to spec people get hurt. One girl actually got scalped.  &gt; *T*here have been cases where a remissive surgeon left surgical instruments inside a patient’s body **and** engineers **causing** an explosion by neglecting rudimentary conversions.   The last sentence isn't really relevant to the point and kind of uppercuts it a bit. Perhaps just say 'If they were diligent shit wouldn't have fucked up'.   &gt; To personally reduce the risks of carelessness, I make sure to be meticulous both at work and in every day life. It could be as simple as taking a second glance to make sure the **customer's** *medication* is correct or checking for my keys, phone and wallet every time I walk out the door. Each consciously made decision towards a well-practiced habit can eventually become instinctive. By doing so, I will be less likely to rush in a stressful scenario.  This is a really good chunk of sentences. I put in customer's and changed drug to medicine because for a moment I thought you were talking about LSD or Ecstasy. This is also a good point. I get used to doing it by the book so I can just do it on autopilot. Less stressful that way.   &gt; Responsibility, another significant trait, comes in two ways: responsibility towards society and responsibility *for* oneself. My father once told me about a boy who trekked through a snowstorm in search of his sheep but ended up losing his legs to the cold. The boy was trying to fulfill his duty to his family but failed to be responsible to his own health.   DDDDDDDDD8  &gt; Sometimes, like the boy, I become overwhelmed and forget to be responsible *for* myself. *Once,* during my history debates, I worked myself to exhaustion and ended up getting sick. At the final debate I was so ill that I couldn’t utter a full sentence without coughing. My goal had been to help my team win but my coughs rendered my arguments difficult to understand.  &gt; ~~In this manner, I hurt my team’s chances of winning.~~ **I need to work on balancing** the two kinds of responsibility because giving up one kind of responsibility will impede the other. No sheep is worth an amputation and I must always try to see the bigger picture.  I am going to suggest, by my own personal opinion, that you end with 'amputation' and take off the rest of that sentence. It has more of a punch that way.   OVERALL This is very good and I agree with every single point. Even if I didn't already, you would've convinced me. My main thing is that you should make it more personal. Since this isn't a formal analysis on genetics and it is more of an opinion/experience thing, you should try to put yourself in there. It is about you, after all, and by personalizing it you'll keep the interest of the reader. Distancing phrases like 'the definition of this' and 'People say this' should be replaced with 'I feel that this means that' and 'In my opinion, blah blah blah'. People will read anything on any subject if it's more personal.   The other thing to work on is patching up holes, transitioning from one thought to the other. I generally knew where you were going but it took a minute and it shouldn't. More than likely when you write, you think of one thing you want to say, write it down, then think of the other thing you want to say and write THAT down. But between those two thoughts is probably a bunch of thoughts. You take out that bridge and people will get lost. When you first write anything, you should just write down literally every thought that comes into your mind, even if it isn't on topic and don't worry about grammar or anything. Rough drafts are SUPPOSED to be rough. It'll help you map out how it flows so you can keep the structure in tact. My creative writing teacher told me, 'First thing you do is carve; you can polish later'.   You were clear with what you were trying to say and your voice, while needing a little development, is strong and interesting. Be confident in what you wrote!",r

f0xvz,f0xvz,thisisntme_seriously,"I need your help to snap me out of something, Reddit.  I've been with my boyfriend for about six months.  We are in our late 20s.  I really adore him and love spending time with him. His family is great, and they like me back.  I see things working out very well for us.  Here is the complication.  A few months before we started dating, I dated a guy for about a month.  We immediately clicked, I was certain it was going somewhere, then he suddenly had some sort of internal crisis and decided that we couldn't date.  I was absolutely devastated.  He and I have stayed good friends, though.  The situation has bothered me ever since, as he never explained why he decided things wouldn't work, and all of our conversations and interactions seem to me like everything would have been exceptional.  He and I see each other pretty frequently, and it is absolutely 100% innocent and platonic.  Neither of us have said or done anything that would be considered suspect.  Then, recently, he sent me a message saying that he has a girlfriend, I have a boyfriend, and we're both happy, but he never was able to explain why things didn't work, and so he's felt really guilty.  We talked, I was honest and told him that, yes, I am very happy, but yes, it always bothered me, and we came out of the conversation both acknowledging that we consider each other a great friend.  I had managed to get to the point where talking to him was almost just like talking with and spending time with any other friend.  Now I feel like I did when he first told me it wouldn't work.  Let me be clear: I have *zero* desire to change anything about the situation as it is.  I adore my boyfriend.  I know I neglected any description of him, but he is really amazing and I absolutely want to be with him.  I also do not want to ruin my other friend's new relationship.  He's a good guy and deserves to be happy.  What I want is advice on how to stop feeling the way I do.  I can't even begin to describe what a terrible person I feel like for wondering how things could have been different, even if I don't want to change anything now.  I absolutely don't want to hurt anyone; I just want myself to stop hurting and be able to appreciate my boyfriend and my friend for the great people they are in their current roles in my life.  tl;dr:  Old wounds reopened, conflict with current love life, how to recover?",r

s7398,s7398,whatamigettinginto,"So, last semester there was this guy in my class who I worked with (in a group) on a couple small in-class projects. He seemed pretty nice. We exchanged a couple emails over winter break, but otherwise, besides a single (school-related) Facebook message he sent me about a month ago (that I answered but he didn't respond further), I haven't seen or interacted with him whatsoever since. I'm 21 and he's a couple years older, we're both graduating next month.  About a month ago, [I came here to /r/relationshipadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/ql7mz/guy_messaged_my_friend_to_ask_if_i_like_him/) to get thoughts on the fact that he messaged a friend of mine (who he's never met) to ask if she knew if I 'liked' him but not to tell me he asked. After she told him well, I don't know, why don't you just ask her yourself? he claimed that he didn't even realize he had hit send on that message to her and that he would never have the guts to ask me himself.  Now, I got a message from him that said basically: I finally have the courage to tell you I like you, I don't know why but I do, and I'm not going to bother you or anything but I just needed to say it. Then later he sent a message again saying he was drunk when he wrote that first message, but he still means what he said.  I am turned off by how he's approached me and I have a bad feeling about this, but I really don't know how to respond to these messages.",r

I got a long email from her about how awesome I am and how she wants to be with me. I was a little creeped out by that so I told her that I'm sorry but I don't feel the same way and so now I think that it'd be like I'm using her if I keep seeing her, knowing that I can reciprocate her feelings.  24 hours later I get an email that she's been staring at her phone hoping I would call and she's sick and it just goes on and on. So I called her to see if she was okay. And at one point there was actually a flash of anger in her - she said, ""so what have you been doing all this time if you didn't feel anything.""  I am actually honestly scared that she's going to boil a bunny rabbit or something else.  How did I get here? Are we not allowed to have casual sex anymore?",r
1f577f,1f577f,,"I'll try to make this a long story short. Me and this girl have been friends for about 3 1/2 to 4 years. We actually went to most if the same schools a kids but didn't start hanging out until I was 20 and she was 19. I asked her out and we went on a date. Everything was good but on the second or third date, I found out she was married/separated and she was considering working things out and getting back with her husband which ended up being the case. Usually this would be the end but we decided to remain friends. She liked me because i would come smoke her out whenever she called without ever expecting any ""favors"" and i liked her simply because she was good company. She same deep intellectual conversations comfortable, and she was always baking something.   Anyways her husband moves down here and i actually met the guy and was friendly and all with him. He knew how we meet and all and claimed to be fine with it. This soon changed. All of the sudden she was to have nothing to do with me. But either her weed addiction was strong enough or we became such good friends (I'd like to think it was a mixture of both but I'm on the Indie here so my vision is blurred.) that she didn't care. Every day while he was at work, i would sneak in for or daily smoke session.   We shared poetry (we both write), talked religion, science, family, love, all the touchy subjects and never an awkward moment. Nothing sexual EVER happened. Nothing. She'sone of the best mothers I've ever seen and it didn't take too long of watching her day to day life for me to fall had over heels. Thus continues for years and we never got caught.  Eventually they broke up and he moved to Tennessee. I continue to play my role as the good guy but she still shows no signs of wanting me as anything more than a friend. This confuses me because she always compliments me on how good of a father/husband she thinks i would be and how all kinds of girls would kill for a guy in my situation who cared and payed attention as well as i do. It basically says to me ""you're exactly what i want but i don't want it.""  Now that i have enough poetry about her to make a small book and SOOOO MANY nights (I'm talking every night for years) invested into this ""friendship"", she tells me she's moving to Tennessee in two weeks to patch things up and it's most likely that we'll never sew each other again.  Do i play the good guy and keep my pride and dignity or should i tell her how i feel? I have nothing to lose but honestly, i think she knows. She seems like she lives hour husband enough that my live wouldn't matter but i don't want to be left with the ""what ifs""  Tell me how it is.   **Tl;dr: boy meets girl. She's married.

krft0,krft0,the_night,"To preface this:    I'm a sixteen year-old female (bisexual, but I crush on men only once in a blue moon), and I met my best friend (let's call him Tom) five years ago in a city about nine hours away from where I live currently. We really weren't great friends at first--we spent a lot of time making fun of each other and generally just joking around.   Then, four years ago, I moved away to where I live now--nine hours away from where Tom lives. We started chatting through IM and quickly became very good friends. We got past the Insult-Each-Other phase and would often chat for hours upon end about girls, porn, and the meaning of life. I consoled him whenever he broke up with whatever-girl-he-was-dating-at-the-time and he consoled me whenever a girl crushed my dreams of dating her.    We eventually became such good friends (helped along by our raging hormones, of course) that we started having cybersex. Which was very nice. We somehow managed to keep our cybersex strictly removed from our feelings regarding each other (I wasn't bothered whenever he started dating a girl, and vice-versa) and we became... well, more than friends, but not really in a relationship. Best friends with sort-of benefits.   Our friendship was jaunting along just fine until last November, when I started dating a girl (let's call her Tammy). Tammy was, shall we say, extremely attractive, and she knew it. She was the sort of person who enjoyed manipulating people. After we got past the initial ""hey, we're dating, what do we do now"" phase, she started trying to cut me off from everyone I knew--she would tell me that ""so and so thinks you're weird, the_night,"" and ""I heard someone gossiping about you, saying you were a whore.""    After a while, this made me extremely uncomfortable, and I broke it off in December--just in time for winter break.    I told Tom (who had been very happy that I was in a relationship, because I was happy) that I had broken it off--all he really had to say was ""I don't think that's such a good idea, the_night. She seemed like a pretty decent person.""    When I came back from winter break, I discovered that Tammy was trying to get me expelled from school. She had told the principal that I was stalking her, spreading rumors that we'd had sex, and generally harassing her. (Tom's reaction to this: ""I am going to gut her like a fish."") I managed to get all of this cleared up in February, with my mother's help, but I found that after everything, that I had become paranoid of others.    I stopped speaking to Tom for a while until summer came, when I went to go visit his city. We met for lunch--the first time we'd seen each other in four years. I was still recovering from what happened with Tammy, so I put up a rather hostile front, since I wasn't sure about what sort of person Tom was in real life. The first thing out of my mouth was, ""You sound like a girl.""    Lunch was rather awkward, because not only was I not sure about him, but my entire family was there, and they all thought we were dating. I left feeling sort of sad that I didn't get to have a heartfelt chat with him like I thought I would have.    He didn't speak to me for a month. I thought he was at camp the entire time, but he was avoiding me (though I didn't realize that until later). Over the month, I discovered that I was beginning to have a crush on Tom, and when we finally spoke again in late August, I told him that. He asked what I wanted to do--if I wanted to be friends with benefits or even have a long-distance relationship--and I told him I really wasn't sure, but I wanted to be more than just friends. He promised that he wouldn't avoid me again.    Well, it's late September. He hasn't spoken to me since very early in the month, when he seemed a bit down. I am immensely worried about him. I've discovered that he has a girlfriend now, but I don't know if that's part of it.   I don't care if we get into a relationship or not--I just want my best friend back. I've considered taking the car and driving up to his city for a weekend--on my own--just to see what's wrong. I have the funds for gas. I've also considered just waiting it out to see.

Parents have the legal right to tell him what to do and to move him across state and federal borders if they so choose.   The viability of doing it to a physically resisting 17 year old is an issue.   No courts in the country would stop the parents of a minor from taking him to the country of his birth if they choose to, unless there is a truckload of evidence that it will be a huge detriment to the minor.  And even then.... still probably would not happen.  &gt; Even if sent back to India, you're a citizen now and could contact the consulate and get them to help you get back here.  LOL what? Since when?  Australian government, at least, has made it clear that they will not step in to assist their citizens overseas unless they are involved in a major event like huge terror plots etc (such as the Bali bombings) - they're not going to send a bunch of AFP over to India, kick down a door and rescue OP then put him on a plane back to Australia.    See for example the issue with Tara Brown of 60 Minutes and the huge issue she got into when attempting to help a mother rescue her kids from Lebanon where they'd been taken illegally by their father.  Those kids were citizens.  If your comment were true, their mother could have made a phone call and Aussie Government would have got her kids back.  Instead, kids are still in Lebanon, mother has been deported from the country and the kids (who are citizens) are growing up there instead.   Australian (and other) governments have a LOT less power overseas than you seem to think they do.  They have all sorts of legal protocols they have to follow, and stomping into any other country and demanding things (like that the country in question give them custody of a minor who is *also a citizen of that country* ) is the quickest way to fuck up decades of political cooperation.",l
jeyd5,jeyd5,backbeatbozo,"Sorry for the wall of text guys, I just need to vent somewhere.. I don't  really know where to turn so if I'm in the wrong subreddit I'm very sorry.  So, the backstory:  I'm 27 now, shes 26. We met while i was playing a gig in Stockholm, she hooked up with me and we spent the night together. 4 months later she calls and says she wants to move in with me (I lived 600km away). It was really cute and flattering. Since then we've lived together.  We've had our ups and downs of course, she is extremely outgoing and easy to like, makes new friends easily and is mostly cheery. By contrast I am more reserved, like quiet evenings with my computer on reddit, starcraft and such. I'm a really friendly guy though, love home parties and dancing. My point is that I'm not a weird shut-in neckbeard, I'm just not as outgoing as she is. And there's one of our problems. She craves extreme amounts of attention, and as soon as I seem a bit 'into myself' that means 'I don't love her anymore'. I just don't need as much attention or confirmation that she needs.   Last fall we moved south to study, I'm in environmental engineering and shes becoming a teacher. She used to be into gymnastics, and when we moved she didn't get to practice her hobby. She tries loads of new sports and gets into volleyball. I had a lot of pressure during school, and fell in a bit of a rut. She made it known that she wanted me to cheer up and do stuff that i liked to do to make me feel good about myself.  Come summer she found a job in the new town, while I wasn't so lucky. I had to move home northwards to work during the summer. She stays, and plays volleyball. We've been talking every day while I've been gone, and she said she loved/missed me, that I was her prince, and so forth.   When I finally get home, we have a talk. We decide to work on our relationship and everything that could make things better for us. While making dinner she starts crying uncontrollably and breaks the news. I panic and tell her I'm willing to forgive her, if she only leaves him and gives me a chance to change myself and our situation. She says she can't accept my forgiveness because she has feelings for him though she loves me. And we can't be together because of that. I beg her not to go back to him, but she left anyway. That night I went on a self-destructive drinking spree, and caught the first train home.  At the moment I'm just running. I'm with my family up north gathering my thoughts and planning my next course of action.  My problem is that we still have a rather large apartment together for another 3 months. I don't want to just leave my studies, but if i go down I'm facing maybe 3 months living with her. I don't know if I can handle it. All my stuff is down there, and our 2 cats. If i stay up here i need a job and a place to stay like, yesterday..   I still love her, shes been my best friend and I don't want to put her any any financial trouble if I refuse to go back, so I'm at a loss for what to do.. I wish we could sort it out and get back together, but I'm afraid that if I open myself to her and beg her to come back she'll shoot me down Hindenburg style.  I'm a crying, blubbering mess and I hope anyone with similar experience can help me get through this.  **tl:dr** My attention-junkie gf got together with her volleyball trainer while I was away working, and is still with him. And I'm doomed to live with her if I go back to school.  Much love, O  **EDIT** Thanks for the words of encouragement guys. I really really REALLY appreciate it.

czmhn52,43xhng,ThisDerpForSale,"You can try filing a police report, but the police are almost certainly going to see this as a civil dispute.  Which means your only recourse, if you can't work it out with her, is to [sue her in small claims court](https://www.legalaidnc.org/public/learn/publications/small-claims/default.aspx) for the value of your items (small claims can only be for money, generally, not for specific performance).

That may be enough to scare/prod her into letting you in to the pod.  Most lawyers will do a free, short consult, during which they'd tell you how much they would charge for such a letter.

While I had cancer the girl who I was conviced I would marry cheated on me because she was turned off by my cancer ( real nice) Since then I took time for me to be single and worry about getting back on track. More recently..about this last summer I took to online dating. I got sick of the bar scene. I am personable and social but it seems like people go out now and stay in their cliqs and its super awkward to approach a girl. My next recourse was online dating, kind of a mistake.  several dates and several misses. I guess my feeling lately is that I am getting older and I just feel like its impossible to meet someone. I am a guy and I am sure its rare to hear that from one but I really want love from a companion in my life and I am just sick of the frat boy life style. Am I over reacting?",r

c234b3x,idx29,AnotherAsh,"Sorry to say that this does not look good for your relationship. In my book, if someone is unwilling to change something as insignificant as a facebook relationship status, its not a good sign. It may seem stupid to someone, and they may not understand it, but if it means that much to the person they care about, they'll do it anyway. Also, if her relationship status has caused her trouble before, I assume this isn't the first time she has tried to play this game.  Also, I dont know any girl who doesn't love cute messages like that from her boyfriend. While I think some people go a little crazy with the facebook PDA, the occasional adorable message is always cute. If she deleted it, its because she didnt want anyone, or more likely, specific people, to see it.  The phone thing, could go either way, however, into the bathroom is a bit obsessive.. The biggie (and if you had to go this far, you already knew what you would find) is a deal breaker. Even is she promised never to do it again, the trust is broken. She did it, you caught her, and she can't take it back. I'm surprised that the ""biggie"" was that she told someone she was single on her dating site profile instead of the fact that she still HAS a dating profile in the first place. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think if you are on a dating site to actually find a boyfriend, and you find a guy that you love and are serious about, the profile's getting deleted.   I stayed with someone for far too long after I found out some not great things about them, and from experience, I hope you go with your gut (and the pretty hard facts) about this one and end it.

I know he is younger and not ready (he said 5 more baby free years) understandably. I just can't wait that long. We have never lived together and we are talking about moving into our own place this spring/summer.  I don't know if I should leave the relationship now so I can mourn it and get on with my life so I can be ready to being a new relationship with someone who is ready to be a father. Time and age shouldn't be a huge factor but right now it feels like I need to make some decisions.   anyone have any advice or imput?  EDIT Spelling  Hey Thanks everyone! I really appreciate all your advice! I know 26 is young (depending who you're talking to) But i just pictured myself having children before 30.  I am still very much in love with him and we have a lot of history but we have spent time apart which has allowed us to grow as individuals. I am looking forward to the future with him hopefully we do move in together. Thanks again so much! very helpful.,r
e41lhr3,96max9,niceandsane,"&gt; Either way, I absolutely believe he told the buyer about the possible listing when she originally went to him.   Which makes absolutely no sense. As a real estate agent, his first priority is always to get the listing. If he knew the guy was interested, by getting the listing and *then* telling the guy he would pocket 6% of the sale price. By not getting the listing he gets nothing. So what's in it for Joe if he isn't in cahoots with the guy?   He's low-balling grandma, getting a kickback from the guy, and making grandma spend money on unnecessary repairs. Grandma needs the advice of an unbiased real estate lawyer to unwind the deal now. She's selling her home without the representation of either an attorney or a real estate agent under contract and getting taken to the cleaners.

During our flirting stage before we started dating she invited me to a party, we drove together and she invited another guy, who she was holding hands with and also make out with. I was shocked and had no idea she was like that with anyone else. Later that night she ended things with him and they never talked again. That was a flag for me and seemed strange. Things started getting serious with us and I got suspicious because she would hide her phone sometimes while she was texting. One night she slept over and she got a text from some guy. I checked her phone, and still don't know if that is ok for me to have done, and found that she was flirting with other guys, one my friend. Another flag for me so I confronted her and she said she felt really bad and won't do it anymore. She stopped and then we began dating. It was then summer so she went home, 500 miles away. This whole time she was still texting her ex boyfriend who lives at home, I traveled up there three times and found out, by checking her phone again, that she had met with him a few times and went so far as having sex with him. I confronted her on this too and we had a long talk, she said she'd understand if we broke up but I said I was willing to keep trying. She vowed to not talk to him again, and now three months later it seems as if she's stopped. I now have all her passwords for social media, but am wondering if her type of behavior will ever truly stop and even though it seems as if she has stopped I find myself being curious and looking for ways to catch her thinking that she has only become sneakier. I think I am handling this situation immaturely and should trust her more, but I have instances when it becomes so hard for me to not be scared.",r

8iawq5,8iawq5,100_count,"Question:  Landlord is blatantly lying to a tenant about something pertinent to tenant safety.  Is this a situation that can be improved by hiring an attorney?  Details:  Had a gas leak and called the utility to shut off gas.  The technician confirmed it was an issue with the plumbing, not an appliance.  Landlord (property management company) sent their ""trusted"" plumbing contracting company to fix the issue.  A week later gas was turned on and my wife and I returned from work to a home filled with gas (worst than ever).  Had the gas company come out to shut it off a second time.  Plumber ""fixed"" the issue a few days later.    It appears bypassing the gas utility locks and reconnecting to the gas main without gas utility verification/supervision is violation against California Penal Code, Section 498 and Section 593c (I'm a total layman, so I could be wrong).  I asked the landlord to provide documentation proving that this occurred and expressed I believed this was encompassed within the landlord's responsibility to ensure tenant safety.  First the landlord said they would not verify (in email record).  Then they said the gas company can't give out this documentation (over phone call).  Then the property management group said they called the gas company and confirmed that the gas company had verified they supervised both reconnections to the gas main (over phone call).    I called the gas company.  They said they don't have any record of the gas ever being reconnected after the first shut off, and they were about to send me a end-of-service closeout bill.  I asked if there was any way they could provide this in writing, and they said they can't without a subpoena.  They also said the recording of my call to them could also be retrieved by subpoena.  I haven't told the property management company of this conversation yet (trying to fit this all between breaks at my job).  Not sure if I should until I decide if I should involve an attorney.  Meanwhile the landlord is pressuring me to continue to schedule appointments with the same contractor (for an issue that may or may not be related to that described here).  They refuse to use another contractor.  The property management supervisor lost his temper (over the phone) when I told him I canceled a drywall repair appointment until I had a chance to have either the gas company or a city inspector confirm the plumbing work was done to code (it looks pretty sloppy to me, but I'm a layman here too).

At first i thought it was fine because he was living with me and my roomates until the lease was up so we can move in together after. We go to school full time and i work about 24 hours a week Monday Wednesday Friday. We now live together and I basically have paid for everything. Utilities, groceries, gas, everything. I was supposed to save up in the summer so i could apply to law schools by now but i have no money whatsoever because he still doesn't have a job. I figured hes a Man so I shouldn't bother him about finding a job, but he never took the intiative to look. Its to the point where I now have to ask him if he's applied anywhere. 9 times out of 10 its a no. He has applied only when I ask. So far hes only applied to Burger King, kfc, Target, and JC Penny. He donates plasma every now and then to get money but its like $20 a visit. Our 2 year anniversery was August and he didnt do anything for me, no gift, no surprise. So I said lets go to outback, which I paid for.... I told myself its because he still doesnt have a job so i brushed it off. BUT yesterday was my 21st Birthday. I didnt make any plans with my family or my friends because i thought my bf had plans for me, he never said anything about what to do for my birthday on the days before so I figured he was going to surprise me. He did not. I came back from school with nothing. He told me he was taking me to the mall to go see a movie, End of Watch. I knew he didnt have anything planned and i called him out on it, I wasnt angry, I was hurt. After my shower I saw he went to get me flowers. Great right? But then he told me I needed to pay for the movies now becuase he didnt have enough... I wanted to cry. We went to the movies, came back, and went to bed.

ccwrq3i,1oxzoz,zombieraptors,"I would say to judge your relationship with your gf by her own opinions and not those of her family. The problem seems to be that your gf has some morals different than you. You might want  to talk to her in private about her stance on equal rights. She may come from a very strict household and is afraid to blatantly disagree with her parents. This doesn't make it okay, but at least you will know if her morals are in line with yours. If she is actually anti-gay and anti-evolution you may want to talk to her in private to see why she feels these things, maybe you can persuade her to see your point of view (though the chance is slim).   Unfortunately, I feel like you're going to have to make a difficult decision. If her perspective on such important topics is so opposite to yours, it may be a sign that the relationship won't be compatible In the long term.

We've been staying at each other's places for the past 4-5 weeks and had sex only 3 times in that time period. She's gone down on me before when we didn't have sex but the last 2 times I've stayed over it felt like she wasn't interested in that. I'm not sure if she's just trying to be ""chased"" but the 3 times we have gone ahead with it she says things like ""You need to behave"" or ""You're going to miss the movie"" in what seems like she's being semi-serious. The last time she did that I just kind of rolled over and said ""okay"" and passed out. Now I have an issue that anytime she's not wearing normal clothes I get a serious erection. When we cuddle it makes me want to rip her clothes off and go at it. Now if we don't do anything or she doesn't make me cum I feel uncomfortably aroused and sexually frustrated until I do.

o6aea,o6aea,,"Hi reddit!  I had an absolutely terrible breakup 2 years ago with a girl in college.  We had an extremely intense (and somewhat messed up) relationship for about a year.  At some point she cheated on me, and I think was very premeditated.  Several months later I broke up with her, which wound up being extremely messy as we continued sleeping with each other.  After that came to an end, I began seeing somebody else, but I simultaneously lost my mind.  I had severe anxiety, and I was ruminating constantly about how she cheated on me or how to kill myself.  At some point, I told her about the dreams I was having about killing her.  Fast forward 2 months, and I had apparently irritated her enough about refusing to pay for her stolen bicycle (stolen from my place) that she used me telling her about my dreams to get a restraining order against me.  Then the university got involved, and she manipulated the university's investigation (the investigator herself told me she was scared of the girl) into badgering me for about 6 months.  So here's the thing.  My depression and anxiety are long gone (woot zoloft!),  I've had other relationships, but I still find myself thinking about that relationship way more than I want to.  It's not like the ruminations I was having, but it's in the same vein.  The events of the relationship just keep stirring up.  Has anybody else been through something similar?  How did you deal with the long-term thoughts of exes?  TLDR:  Crazy relationship -&gt; Messy breakup -&gt; depression -&gt; latent thoughts of girl.  What do?  Thanks for your input.

That being said, threesomes *do* unlock a lot of unexpected emotions, so you should both practice strong communication and make sure you're not jumping into this blindly if you decide to go through with it.

1mnsd9,1mnsd9,,"I'm an 18 year old male who's never had a real relationship before, never been on a date, and has yet to this day kissed a girl. That all changed after a girl I met on OkCupid and we messaged back and forth and agreed that we liked each other. For the sake of anonymity, let's call her S. We continued texting each other for a few days and decided to meet at her dorm (she goes to a different college than me, but it's not too far). She has three roommates, one of which is her older sister. Let's call her C.  Let's just take a moment for me to establish that I come from a home where respect is a big deal. I learned from a very young age to be respectful, nice, and just overall be a good person. My date's sister on the other hand, is almost the opposite...  For the first hour, we were at a little food court they had on campus and C dominated the conversation with topics that I had absolutely NO CHANCE to bring anything to the table. She talked to S about things like friends the two of them had (not letting me in on any of the inside jokes they were making), stuff they had to do for their classes, and a handful of other things that I obviously would have had no clue about. C made absolutely NO EFFORT into bringing me into the conversation. In fact, both times that I tried to bring myself into the conversation, C interrupted me and went off on some other topic that was obscure to me. For all intents and purposes, I could have not been there at all and it would have changed nothing.  Then we walked back to their dorm room. I thought that maybe now I could start a more general conversation and get the ball rolling for S and I. Sadly, that wasn't the case. C got on her phone and went to Vine and we started watching a bunch of cat videos. Granted, there were some funny videos, but it was still a ""conversation cock block"" that prevented me from being relevant to anything going on. Eventually, about 2 hours later, we decided to go watch a movie in some of S and C's friends room (they had a 40"" flat-screen). That movie didn't happen though because the people's room were in we're playing Call of Duty. So we just all sat down and watched these guys play CoD. This part was actually nice in comparison to the rest of the date because S and I sat next to each other, her hand on my leg and my arm around her. We had some conversation that didn't really go anywhere, but for roughly 45 minutes we actually had the closest thing to ""personal time"" all day (in a room with like 7 people).  Before all of this happened, I had it in my head that I was going to kiss her. It was the first time we had actually met in person. It was our 'first date'. We liked each other from texting and skype calls. I decided ""YOLO"". I'm gonna kiss her before I left that night.  It was getting late, so I said I had to go (I was a 45 minute drive back to my place, in the dark, in a major US city). S walked me back to my car where I hugged her, told her that we needed to have an 'alone date' next time and got in my car and left. I didn't kiss her. The reason wasn't because I was too chicken or anything. It was that I had just been on the least personal date that I could have even imagined. There was no romance. There was no 'special connection' made. All of it because I was really just the third wheel on my own first date.  I don't even want to call it a date anymore because it was SO impersonal. I'll just call it the ""let's make sure we're not serial killers because we met on the internet meet-up"". Because calling it a date makes it a pretty sh*tty date. Calling it a meet-up means it wasn't that bad (though it was still pretty bad either way).  So tell me, have any of you ever been the third wheel on your own date?  What should I do from here? I do like S, so I want to try this again but in a more personal setting. But S and C are very close sisters, so I can't take S without C. How can I tell S that I just don't like C because she's rude and overall not my favorite person without upsetting S? As I said, I like S. I really do! But C is a total pain in the ass and ruined my first 'date' to the point that I don't even want to call it a date! WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?!?  TL;DR- Met a girl online. When I met her in real life, we hung out at her place. Her sister was rude and didn't allow me into any conversations. Was the third wheel on my own first date. WTF?!?",r

At the end of August, ALL rent agreement for every apartment building in town end. On September 3rd, all new apartment leases begin.   If you're staying in the same apartment, it's NBD for the most part. Moving, however, is a special brand of hell.   Our apartment property has been seriously gunning to get into properties (where the leasers are moving out) to upgrade their apartments while these leasers are still living in apartment. My partner and I didn't buy the ""we're blessing you with a new counter/bathroom schpeel"" as we'll only be living there another few weeks. Packing is hard enough. We don't need dust and broken glass/granite acting as a cock block to our packing. We have two cats. We don't need a new granite counter or whatever at the expense of stressing our cats out even more so than they are already with packing. Partner works from home and 200% does not need that racket. So that's no#1  Apartment property decided to up the ante and offers totes to all leaving leasers who will allow these contractors up in their business. Can't. Roll. Eyes. Any. Goddamn. Further. Into my head. No #2  Again, apartment property decides to up their offer. This time, a tote AND a Visa gift card. Partner and I talk it over. But we decide with a track record like they have (ex. They said we'd have a patio by week 3 after moving in - it's a year later and there's no patio) the renovations would probably last an ungodly amount of time and screw is over in terms of packing. Final no. No#3.   Now all of that context lands us to this week when we get a notice saying that at such and such a time on such a such a date, contractors will be entering our home to renovate.... Everything we had repeatedly said no to. Both partner and I had magnificent WTF moment. I ask partner to ask (because I'm lazy, that's why)  the front office if we'll be getting the Visa gift card and tote. AT LEAST. since we're being forced into this. Along with a 'sorry not sorry that's the only time we could book the renovators' [a. Bullshit. I've seen the renovators since our next door neighbors took the bait and allowed them entry - they're just the regular maintenance folks and are here all the time. B. Sounds a whole lot like your problem, not mind] we were told they were plum out of gift cards but would be thrillllleeddd to offer us a tote.

Despite this, I have a response from the property manager (after forwarding the city's e-mail) saying they have no record of placing them.  It's clear to me that the association placed the signs, even though they claim they have no record of doing so.  I guess part of what frustrates me is a belief that it should be illegal to place private signs abutting a public street without some kind of requirement that someone accept ownership of them.   I literally have both e-mails from the city stating they are the HOA's and the property manager saying they are the city's.",l

1x17c4,1x17c4,bassplayer3,"Hello! 23M here asking for advice for my gf [20F] and I.   Some background first of all. I am one of those men that find makeup, for the most part to be a huge turn off. I'm not sure why, but when I look at a woman and I can notice that she is wearing makeup, all I see is a mask. It looks like a clown mask, or a raccoon, or just unnatural. I'm not sure if this is some deep rooted problem in my brain somewhere or what, but it's something that I've never been able to get past.   Now before you crucify me, I want to express that I understand the art side of it, I understand the freedom and creativity side of it too. I just really don't like the social stigma that you 'need' to wear makeup to look beautiful. I think my gf has incredible natural beauty and doesn't need to wear any makeup at all! When we first started dating, she rarely wore anything more than mascara. Lately she has been experimenting more, and frankly, I find it a huge turn off. Really dark eye shadow, silver eye liner, white lips, eyeliner flare?, etc. I just really don't like it, I can't see past the mask.  When she started asking me what I thought about her makeup when she started experimenting, I told her that, for my entire life, I've never been a fan of makeup. I told her that I find it unnatural, and that it takes away from her beauty from my point of view. In trying to compromise, I expressed that a LITTLE bit of subtle eyeshadow and some mascara can be that extra bit that makes her eyes pop, but that unnatural colors or too much just looks like a mask.   Now lately, she's been experimenting, and from my point of view, she isn't understanding my idea of subtlety. She's got eyeliner flare, and different colors of eyeliner, multiple colors of eyeshadow, and face stuff that makes her face a different color. Every time she asks me if I like it, I try to skirt around the question because she started (understandably) getting offended whenever I told her I didn't like it. She's expressed that 'she can't win with me'.   I just don't know what to do, and she doesn't know what to do. I've told her to do what makes her feel good, and to make herself feel beautiful. But then she asks me what I think, and I don't want to lie to her about what I feel, because as I see it, a turn off is a turn off, and that should be communicated. She has expressed what facial hair styles and hair styles on me she doesn't like, and I feel like this is a similar situation.   This hasn't been a problem for me until she started bar tending and experimenting. When we first started dating, she didn't wear unnatural makeup, and that was part of what drew me to her. She was comfortable in her beauty, and comfortable with who she was. This new makeup trend makes me feel like she is trying to hide. I think she is gorgeous as is, and I just don't know what to do.  Tl;dr. Gf started wearing more makeup and experimenting. I have always found makeup to be a turnoff. Problems ensue.",r

caqmud5,1h2hvw,wise-up,"When I went to grad school, I was in a similar boat - couldn't find my records but needed proof of immunizations. The university health center just drew titers, at no charge, and it was not a big deal. Your school may or may not offer this for free, but it's worth asking.   Also, at least in my state, clinicians are only required to maintain records for 7 years after a child turns 18.  As others have stated, your doctor may not have any obligation to have those on file at this point, assuming they kept paper records.    ETA: to clarify, even electronic records are not required here after 7 years, but since they're easier and take up less space to maintain, they're less likely to be destroyed. In my old office, we physically shredded paper records a few years after they were no longer covered by the statute because of space constraints.",l
c2w5hki,lvvz5,austinap,"Current med student here.  The first year of med school is tough - not only is it a lot of work, but it takes most people quite a while before they find a balance.  This early in the year, she's still trying to figure out how much work she needs to put in to not fall behind her classmates, and how to balance that with having a ""normal"" social life.   Unfortunately, the approach that a lot of people take is to eliminate everything they can from their lives that is at all stressful or that takes too much time.  Though it isn't exactly fair, if you like her you need to make sure that you're not a stressor in her life.  A lot of people in my class that are dating see their S/Os weekly or less.  Other people make it work to see them more often, but those are usually people that came  into school in a long term relationship.    I also wouldn't read too much into her not inviting you to things with her friends.  Med students can really suck to hang out with - they're stressed, and the tend to talk about school *all the time*.  Classes call also be very cliquey.

1v33ui,1v33ui,FrustratedMarriedGuy,"I am of the 20% (or so I have read online about) of men whom are less interested in sex than my wife. She is the initiator and always has been since we met. We have always been relatively happy in our life together to my knowledge but lately I have been less interested in sex than usual and She is more frustrated than normal at my lack of interest.  I love my wife til the end of the earth, and she verbally and through action reciprocates. Our only issue seems to be in the bedroom. I feel loved. I want to make this clear just because I feel the issue is limited to the bedroom and outside stimuli affecting the bedroom.  It seems like we just aren't clicking in initiating sex. When we do have sex we are both emotionally and physically satisfied. We have trouble agreeing to have sex. I'm too mentally or physically tired often when she initiates.  She initiates, usually at bedtime when we are about to sleep. Not when we first get in bed but after the lights are off and we have been cuddling and watching TV or talking about how our day went. I typically only initiate on weekends in the morning or mid day when we are hanging out around the house. She is not a fan of morning sex so we typically only have sex when I am in the mood at night and she initiates.  Our sex life normally works fine under these conditions but I have been less interested lately and I don't really have a valid reason why. She has verbally stated that she feels like I don't want her physically anymore. I am no less attracted to my wife now that I have ever been. I am just less interested in sex.   I am asking advice because I love my wife and our life together and I feel like I am letting her down as a spouse by not fulfilling her sexual needs as often as she would like. Any advice would be appreciated on getting me/us out of this funk.  Possible relevant information:  Started dating at 21. Moved in together 11 months later due to my work relocation. Decided together that moving in together and relocating was a good idea. Married at 25. Moved back to home (where most of both of our families live regionally) this past Summer again for my work relocation. This again was a mutual decision. Only time we ever seem to argue is about finances and that hasn't been an issue since year one of our marriage. We live comfortably middle class. No children. We both want children, however she is still working on her career so we haven't started trying. Mutual sexual interests from vanilla to roleplay/fantasy fulfillment. No infidelity physical or emotional known or suspected.  TLDR: Need advice on getting out of sexual rut where husband is less interested in sex but no less attracted to or in love with wife.",r

qbg7m,qbg7m,,"Long story short, me and my GF have been dating for 5 years. The only major thing that has ever happened between us was something I did. It was when she had just left for school and I was drunk and feeling very insecure and I kissed and finger banged a girl that had a crush on me. But I told her the night of, and somehow she forgave me. It was a long healing process, and i dont really know why i deserved her forgiveness. But that is the past, and I truly believe she forgave me. Nothing like that has ever happened since, from either of us. We have had, I guess I have had some pretty serious jealousy issues. I am insecure as fuck... When she went away to school I was shitty to her at times. But that really only lasted freshman year of college. I got much better at just keeping it to myself, and I would never have considered myself controlling, just verbally abusive at times. And she has always been very supportive of me, and angry texting while she was at the bar never fazed her. Of course I regret it now, both the time i cheated, and my jealousy while she was at school.   She went away to school, I did not. I went to CC and did a CNA course, tried to get into their nursing program, failed, and now am pursuing a degree in History. But it is my 5th year and because of financial problems probably still have another year before I finish my history associates. I also have accumulated a 4k dollar credit card bill. Payed for CC on it, then got fucked by interest rates. I work but not enough, maybe make 15k a year doing homecare. I hate my job.  She graduated in June, and got a job making 45k. She works at a new hip company in a hip city. Im sure all her co workers are young super successful people all like herself. I feel so fucking intimidated, like how could I possibly match up to someone she is meeting at work!?-serious question like thats how my head has been working lately.  Not to mention her fb  which is just like a big list of guys who have more hair and money than me.    Now I feel incredibly anxious and nervous all the time. I have vocalized my insecurities to her, but not to any grand extent. I generally keep it to myself, and just try to be supportive of her. But always in the back of my head is this nagging feeling of this separation thats happening between us.  We always thought we would move in together after school. But now the financial gap between us is soooo huge that I dont think we could. I feel awkward talking about money now. Going to bars, or out to dinner, or anything it all reminds me of it. and honestly I just dont have money to spend, I am busy paying of my credit card and various other bills that I have.   What should I do, can anyone relate? I feel like I will never be on her level again. She is amazing and so pretty and smart. I am not so amazing, broke, and balding. She tells me she loves me and that its not going to change, but I have awful visions of deceit and just in general I feel like a loser. I dont know why I cant shake it. Even right now at this second my head is just racing, she is at work right now and I just focus on all of the possible negatives. Not to mention money, money is constantly on my mind.

We met through some strange circumstances, pretty much me, her, this other girl and the other guy became a group of close friends after a School-sponsored party. It's a long story.  I started to develop feelings for her almost instantly but so did the other guy. He was more charming than me and he won her over, I didn't really like it that much but I moved on. I got another girlfriend for a little while, and the four of us still hung out a lot. My feelings for her started to subside, or at least I thought they did.  She broke up with her boyfriend a couple months ago and ever since then I've started to develop feelings for her.  We have been flirting progressively more and more over the past couple of months. I considered asking her out, but I'm not that confident... so I didn't. I decided to wait a little longer to make sure she really liked me.  So, fast forward to last saturday. We organized this ""kickback"". 3 guys, 3 girls. There was alcohol involved. I never drank alcohol before in my life but I figured that if I was drunk, maybe I would have the enough courage to finally become Caitlin's boyfriend. It was perfect in my mind. That was my plan.  I knew everyone there and I liked everyone who went except for one guy, who I've never seen in my life, I later found out his name is Jim. Jim was your stereotypical football guy. Confident, etc. You get the picture.  Each guy was assigned a girl (wasn't explicitly stated but it was implied). And I got Caitlin. However, since I don't really have any experience with girls and Jim was a newcomer he didn't really know the ropes and proceeded to get Caitlin extremely drunk and they went into a room and started ""hooking up"". I don't know what happened in there but.... yeah.  Anyway they both come out after a while, I don't really remember because I was so drunk. I remember her constantly repeating, ""oh my god it didn't work out, I got the wrong person"", etc. She ended up sleeping on my lap at some point.  So anyway I slept at her place and everyone left when I woke up and it was just me and her. She talked to me as if nothing bad had happened at all and didn't bring any of that stuff that happened up. It's as if the whole thing never happened. She's pretty much exactly the same towards me now. I asked a friend for advice and he told me to just ignore her texts (so I appear too busy for her time) and flirt with her more in real life. I don't know if that's good advice or not.  I'm really confused. And hurt. And a lot of other things. And I still really like her. And I'm getting some EXTREME mixed signals as to if she likes me back. I don't know if I'm friend zoned or not at this point.   Some advice would really be appreciated right now.",r

cbukn20,1l0ll9,bears2013,"Sorry for not clarifying--it's **not a 3-day notice**, but I was reading that a 3-day notice--basically anything short of 30 days--is *only* allowed when the tenant has violated terms of agreement in some way. Since it's not a 3-day notice, and since there was no given reason on the posting, I assume it has to do with the lease in some way. It just said to vacate by September 1st, and the landlord conveniently can't be reached until Tuesday.  Unless he did something illegal (which he didn't, since there was no mention in the posting), the landlord absolutely HAS to give him 30 days' notice, right? Even if A: he has a month-to-month lease; or, B: he has a year-long lease that ends in September.  He's working today, so I can't reach him to see which it is--I don't know if he continually renews a 1yr lease annually, or has a month-by-month. I feel like it's the latter, but I can't confirm that as a fact. Either way, I think the landlord wants to force them into a different lease agreement.",l

He won't ever initiate kisses nor grab my hand or even be intimate with me. Honestly If I had my way we'd be having sex now. But I'd rather him initiate it or do something.

He could not stop apologizing and eventually we figured out the root of the problem. He has literally no time management skills.

cftb0x0,1z24h9,runtoparis,"I disagree. Men are not really caught up in things like that normally. Usually, they say it because they know the power it holds on us and that we really enjoy it, it means a lot to us, etc. If he loves you, he will show you with his actions rather than say it.  If you say it, you will not really know if he says it back just for it not to be awkward or if it's really because he wanted to say it and you just beat him to it. I've just gone through the same situation with my current boyfriend, I would have said it way earlier but he found the perfect moment and said it, and I was so glad (and relieved!) when he did. :)  Does he show you that he is into you? What do you usually say to each other? Do you say anything at all? My SO and I used to say stuff like ""I like you"", ""wow, you are not all bad"", ""you're quite alright, you know?"" and it was a funny way to tell each other we enjoyed each other, but were not ready to say IT, and still know that we were ""aware"" that it could escalate if we felt like we were there.  Whenever I waited, it was always worth it. Think of it as a new relationship thrill. It's been 2 months since my SO told me that for the first time and we still don't ""overuse"" it. We don't say it every day. When he does, it still gives me a rush and it's special. Obviously it will lose the novelty soon, so it's sort of good to wait for a little while too. Good luck!!",r

1dd4wu,1dd4wu,Mrpaceface,"Ok so me and my girlfriend have been together for around 3.5 years. We started dating my junior year of high school and I went off to college a year after I graduated. It's been a rocky road since our relationship turned to long distance, but it's only an hour away so I come home every other weekend. Now being a college student of course I don't have much money and my vehicle isn't the best on gas, so I try to keep to my every other week schedule. When a holiday would come up such as valentines day I would surprise her by coming and taking her to dinner if I could. Now this semester is almost up, I have this week left and then finals. So I basically have less than two weeks as ill be heading home for the summer next Wednesday, a week from today. This weekend would be my weekend to come down, but as I am almost done with school I decided against it because I deem it unnecessary since ill just be driving back in a couple days. She just blew up when I told her and thinks I'm in the wrong and am a bad boyfriend because she always makes time for me and I never ""sacrifice"" anything for her. Now I will admit she makes her fair share of trips here but she has a job. I don't. She can pay for the gas as I can't. And it's not that I don't think she isn't important enough for me to come down but I think it's a little ridiculous for her to make such accusations that I'm selfish and only do what I want and not what she wants just because I'm choosing not to come down this weekend. Can someone help me out as to why she might think this? She's done this over the past but she's never been this upset about it. Am I wrong and she right?",r

Flash back to early this year. I'm mid 20s, in a long relationship where it feels like I'm unhappy. I'm invited to a wedding 20 hours of plane rides away and meet a friend of the bride. I made up my mind the moment that I saw her that I would try to get to know her despite my current status. After a few days of vacationing, drinking and having fun, I'm getting obvious hints that she is into me and I'm totally playing it up, smiling, flirting, etc. We spend a night together but she stops me before we have any sex. I don't know why, I never mentioned my ties back home or got any ideas of what might be wrong.  Well, I go back home, I live on the other side of the earth from new girl. I can't stop thinking about her until it completely consumes me. I break off my 5 year relationship and go single. Feeling lonely, I start contacting new girl on the internets. We soon videochat every day and start ditching our friends to talk to each other.  Time passes, another friend in the wedding party lands me a job lead in his country (her country too). Perfect, I've been miserable at my job. Well, guess what, the job is in the same city where she lives. I take the job (because it's amazing) and tell myself that I'm not moving for her (did I...?).   Well for the interview, I ask to stay at her place. Yes she says, and very excited. I stay with her in her bed the entire week. We get close, it feels right. Except for sex, she's so nervous that it hurts her, so it happens only a couple times, I initiate but she really did try. I have no idea if it was me or something else. She's been in relationships before.  Well, after the stay, it's summer time and she goes back to her home city. I don't hear from her so much but still keep in contact. I arrive in my new city and start working. I see her every now and then, but it's like we've gone back a few steps. I get tired of this and ask if I have any chance and get a response that says ""I don't know, I think I just need some time. Hope you're ok with this."" This reads as ""no"" to me. What about you?  This has gone on long enough that I totally expected getting dumped, but should I try to find out why? I am really lonely as I'm rebuilding my network of friends here and I'd rather keep a friend if I can. Also, can someone please tell me that I didn't move here for her. I really hope that I did not.

9or9n4,9or9n4,AptGarbage,"On mobile, sorry for formatting issues.  To embellish on the title a bit more:  I have been at this apartment for a year and 3 months, renewing the lease for another year back in July (Austin, TX btw).  I recently became disabled (permanently), which has made the trek up three flights of stairs at my apartment complex very difficult. So difficult, I had taken to sleeping in my car some nights (I no longer have to, thanks to my partner).   Moments ago, I walked into the leasing office and requested a unit transfer so I could sleep in my own home that I pay for. I was certain to mention disability, and I had looked over the lease prior to walking in to confirm there was some kind of verbiage saying a transfer could be accommodated under the Fair Housing Act.  I was told Very Quickly that I have to wait 6 months into my lease before a transfer could even be entertained. Unfortunately the lease I had for a year prior to my renewal doesn't count towards this 6 month time frame, so I'm stuck with a unit I can't even access for another three months (longer if no units are available in January).  So here I am about 5 minutes later, sitting in my car wondering what to do. I can't make it back up the stairs any time soon, so I'll probably head back to my partner's place. This is stupidly inconvenient, and I'm certain there's another way I can approach this. My naive Google searches aren't giving me much.  I'm not having a lot of luck finding information on unit transfers due to disability. I've seen some vague websites mention that a unit transfer would be a reasonable accommodation for a disabled person, but not a lot of advice on how to actually pursue that. Could anyone point me in the right direction? Or even tell me to my face that I'm dumb and just to suck it up?",l

fu52d,fu52d,,"My boyfriend is long-distance. I'm on one side of the country, and he's on the other. Last semester was our first stint apart; it was really difficult, we ended up breaking up and getting back together a few times.  This semester, we planned on having him come here during his spring break. It's expensive, but we thought the money would be there. I wanted to come back for my spring break too, but my finances haven't come through so I decided that if I hadn't gotten the money by my spring break, I'd come back for a weekend, maybe, so we'd at least be able to see each other.  He called this idea frivolous, and said I shouldn't spend my money on such a short trip. In reality, it would be a little frivolous, but I need this. Not seeing each other just increases tension so much, and we lose sight of things when we don't remember the reality of being together. In short, I think the money for a ticket is definitely worth it, because being apart does the relationship more damage than good.  He says he doesn't want to come out for his spring break anymore, he wants to save up for some bigger purchases, etc. That if being apart is damaging, then well, I need to be able to take some damage.

If I suggest something, propose a project, ask her opinion about something it's always shot down or put down.  It's stupid or a bad idea.  If I finish a project it's not as good as a professional.    I work full time.  When I get home she leaves for school almost immediately while I watch our child 3 times a week.  And I watch our child alone every other weekend while shes at class.  So some weeks I get 2 days free to do things that need to be done.  Anyway, it's as if she doesn't understand why I would be tired.  All she says is,"" You just sit there at work.  I don't know why you would be tired."" And even though I constantly say I only get an hour or two after the baby goes to bed to do something before I have to go to sleep it doesn't register or she doesn't take it seriously.    We are coming off a month of school every weekend so it's been a little worse than usual.  My stress levels are maxed out.  I've been so far behind on sleep it's not even funny because I try to stay up now and then to get a few things done around the house.  And then there's sex.  It ain't happening.  I am usually just too tired, stressed, or aggravated to even think about it.  And it doesn't help one bit when she gripes about the fact that it's been a month...or two.  Tac on another month if I hear that.  She's not a monster.  I know I'm laying it on thick here.  I just want to understand.  And I just want it to stop.

It REALLY started to bother me when we saw his ""good friend"" (who is a girl and I never met) at the movie we were at and I asked why he didn't introduce me and he said because he told her about our big fight. He was ashamed to be seen with me after spilling our beans.  He also told his brother (no problem), but also several other friends who I barely know. He claims he's telling the truth but I don't think he should be telling them anything. I'm so tired of this. I feel so exposed and judged and my family is always on his side because he knows I don't gossip so he gets to them first. He threatens (and has) called my mom and tell her bad things about me. Then when I stick up for myself or talk to ONE friend about it, I'm a ""liar"". I lost guy friends of mine because he accused me of having sex with them yet he can have all the girl friends he wants because they're ""good friends"" and have boyfriends.

I stayed away from the story as much as I could until now so I could form a full thought on it without someone else trying to put their feelings on the matter into play.    I don't really have much relation with my mother these days.  She has gotten a lot more unstable and it's not safe for my child to be exposed to that.  My childhood wasn't very good but I try to take as much as I can from all sides into account.  It didn't hit me until recently that every guy she has divorced she has tried to get put in prison.  My step dad right after my father she said molested us kids, to the point of trying to convince me it happened.  She also tried to call in Grand Parents rights over my son who she has never cared for on her own.  At that point she became a threat so I'm done.  That said I feel actions speak very loudly.  I feel like someone willing to kill a baby would have actions to back that up.  You go to prison there would be a record of bad things.  Seven write-ups in 26 years all for small things.  No violence what so ever.  People willing to speak on his behalf that wouldn't normally to say ""this doesn't fit"".  Meanwhile my mother is prone to quick rage.  Small things would make her violently furious.  The things she tried to pin on the guys she split up with...  None of it rings right to me.  There's more to it but I don't want to twist things one way, it could all be unrelated just extremely odd so I don't try to put much thought into it.  The facts of the case brought up don't make sense either.  Cutting up a body with a razor blade?  Even a soft thing like a baby...  There's still a lot to get through with a simple razor blade.  The person that performed an autopsy on the dog was a human doctor.  They did it the way you do it on a person.  Cut from chest to groin with the dog on his back.  Doing that is medically incorrect as it cuts into the dogs stomach while you're cutting.  It was brought up in the trial and caused a lot of question as to if some of the issues with the body was from cutting into the dog incorrectly.  If I'm right and he didn't do it then he shouldn't be in there.  26 years is a lot of time to spend for something he didn't do.  If he did do it, I get that.  I can take that.  But I want clear answers.  And even still 26 years is while to spend with no notable instances against someone the whole time they're in.",l
1pao2p,1pao2p,CooterWrangler,"Hi. I am 24 and female while my husband is 30. We have been together as a couple for fours years and married for two out of those four.  We had pretty regular sex the first couple of months and then thugs began to slow down. It went to once or twice a month down to once a month, to once ever month or so. Currently we have not had sex in over two months. We have recently moved into a place of our own and I thought things would begin to pick up. It has only gotten worse.  The most intimate that we get is a hug. We barely kiss anymore and when we do it is only a peck on the lips. I have no one else to talk to about this so I am kind of hoping to get some feed back here.  His job is full time but not very physically taxing yet he is always so tired when he gets home. My job is part time (34-36 hrs) but I do a lot of running around and I still have more energy than him.   It has gotten to the point where I feel like he is no longer physically attracted to me despite the fact that I have lost weight since our move.

m6ohw,m6ohw,unrequitedhtrowaway,"So there's a guy in my life I've known casually for maybe about two/three years. We met in uni through a course, as friends, didn't really hang out socially but sat together in class, got on well, did the facebook/msn thing, etc. He was a year older than me and graduated 2010.  At the time that we met, I was in a relationship. As we got to know each other a bit my instincts told me he was attracted to me - not in an oppressive way, more like a quiet appreciation, shall we say.   Shortly after he graduated, I got out of my relationship, got into a rebound and then got out of that. I'd chatted to him a bit in that time and I think we'd met for a sandwich a couple of times, and basically, he asked me out on a date.  I was flattered and thought ""well, why not?""; we got on well, he was attractive, he possessed nice qualities and he was (and is) a genuinely nice guy. He'd flirted a little with me here or there every now and then, and the date was nice - but nothing special. Some food and a film and then he dropped me back at my place. Nice, but lacking in fireworks.  I would have happily gone on more dates, however, as I did have a really nice time, and later on in the evening I sent him a small text thanking him for a nice evening. I heard nothing back.  The following day he did the decent thing and told me that while he thought I was nice, he ""didn't think he had the kind of time at the moment that [I] deserved"". I basically took this as man-language for ""You're way too needy and I'm not really into that, sorry"". Which was a fair enough claim, as I was and am.  I was a bit surprised that he'd been interested in me for so long only to apparently give up after one not unpleasant date, but I took it as it was, we had a couple of weeks of awkward non-talking, and then sooner rather than later things were back to normal and we were chatting about gaming and his/my plans, our lives, etc. etc.  Fast forward about a year. I've graduated and I'm looking for work. We haven't really spoken properly in a couple of months, but basically, he texts me about some work his boss has coming up and gets my CV off me - and basically gets me a job.  Since then (maybe a month ago), we've reconnected a bit, found the spark of our friendship again. Now, it's got to the point where we see or talk to each other every day, usually at work, and texting, and msn. We've hung out a few times (it was never something we did massively), I took him for a drink once he got me the job, he asked me to come shopping with him because he wanted some clothes to look nice in for going out and wanted a girl's opinion, etc. etc.  We live in towns that are about half an hour from each other. I don't drive, but he has a motorbike, so either he'll come to my town or he'll pick me up and we'll head somewhere (which is sweet of him, he's put a lot of effort into seeing me sometimes for not even very long; at work he used to drive here on his lunch break so that we could have lunch and catch up).   Anyway, basically, it's got to the point where he's pretty friendly with me. We'll spend lunch together and laugh and chat a lot, he always seems happy to bump into me at work, he texts me as soon as he's home from work to see how I enjoyed my day, and then we'll usually chat on msn for a couple of hours before heading to bed.  I still quite like him. My feelings aren't super intense or clingy, but he's attractive, he's nice, he's friendly, he's laid-back and I really wouldn't mind if he were interested in something more. But is he just being friendly? I'm hardly the kind of girl who'd pursue anything or start the ball rolling, but... well. I guess I just don't know if he's being a bro and welcoming to me, or if he's wondering if I'm feeling the same.  TL;DR A guy I dated once (literally) is being more friendly than usual. Is it just friendliness, or something more?  Edit: We are both in our early twenties and, unless he's been really secret about it during the time I've known him, he's never had a girlfriend.

1t2u81,1t2u81,WhyCant_i_,"This is the first time I've come to reddit for relationship advice. But I want anonymous and unbiased advice. I can handle the harsh truth that some of my friends wouldn't be willing to give. So I'll try and cut to the chase and spare you a novel.   Basically I'm 21,female and he's 23 male. I'm a student and he's active duty Air Force. We're from different types of upbringing other than being middle class. Im from a divorced, dysfunctional family with lots of mental illness. He's from a very stable ""perfect"" family. They act like they've never even heard the word depression, which i suffer severely from. He's stationed here, for a long time, but he's from out of state. We live together, we've been together almost 2 years, we stayed strong through his deployment to Afghanistan and I stayed loyal. No I didn't cheat despite everyone saying ""all military wives and girlfriends cheat"". We get along pretty great other than tiny bickering ""why do you always leave the lights on? Why do you sleep so much lazy? Quit jumping on me in the morning screaming WAKEY WAKEY!!"" Etc..   So here's my issue.....s. he doesn't support me when I'm having an awful bout of depression. I was hospitalized in May for attempted suicide because I wasn't getting the help I needed and had no one to talk to. He was in Afghanistan and I had a lot of bad shit happening in my life. He doesn't understand depression or any other mental illness. When we first started dating he actually thought they were made up things by attention seekers. He refuses to do research and won't talk to me about it and doesn't get that sometimes I do the things I do because I'm depressed. He just thinks I'm lazy.   He never wants to have sex anymore. I don't feel like he's attracted to me. I've actually gotten in shape and I'm in the best shape I've been in my life. Not bragging, just stating facts, 128 lbs, cute face, big boobs, you'd think he would be all over me. I sound like a douche saying that, but its just a detail that's been bothering me.  He doesn't like ANYTHING that I like. We have different tastes in music, movies, I'm an artist, he thinks art is dumb, he just always complains that I've never made HIM any art. But that's because he doesn't inspire me. We don't have that ""passion"", were kind of a boring couple sometimes. We don't have a whole lot in common in the ""likes"" ""dislikes"" category.   He is eventually going to deploy again (sometime next year) and he's said he will not help with rent while he's gone. I don't expect him to but I have no place to go. Not many friends, the ones I do have aren't able to be roomies. So I feel like he's intentionally abandoning me. I'll probably be homeless unless I pull something out of my ass at the last minute.   And last. I have a sort of ""white buffalo"" that I used to date unofficially for years before we got together. I was SO deeply, passionately in love with this person. He was deep, we had deep intelligent conversations, we could talk about anything and I almost became sort of obsessed with this person. Best sex I've ever had, the most gorgeous guy I've ever seen with the most amazing eyes and perfect touch. I still think about him ALL THE TIME. We've both moved on with our lives and don't talk anymore because we agreed we are incapable of being just friends. But I miss him a lot. And I secretly think him and I are ""meant to be"". I've never met someone I was so perfect with. But he had a lot of baggage and problems, like myself, with depression and nothing official ever really happened. He's never had a girlfriend because he's really afraid of commitment.   I've been feeling lately that I'm in my prime, and maybe I should get back out there. I work out, look great, feel great (to an extent) But then again I've grown so comfortable with my SO and we REALLY love each other. It would be a very hard breakup. And I'm afraid after this one I'll be alone forever like my mom. And it would hurt him reallyyyy bad because it would be out of nowhere. Kind of like I don't wanna blow it, because we have a pretty good thing going on. I just don't know what to do. He's so hard to talk to about serious stuff.   If you're still reading....Just hoping for some advice. Apologies in advance if I sound like a total bitch. I already know I'm kind of being one.

A girl gave me her e-mail address, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to do.  I'll give you the context, because it might be an important factor:  I write articles for a gaming website. Today I visited the E3 game convention and interviewed several people there. Among the people I interviewed were ""booth babes"", which are beautiful women that are hired to promote products at trade shows.  I conducted an interview with a woman, and afterward we spent a few minutes chatting. She seemed to enjoy talking with me, said that she'd like to stay in touch, and gave me her e-mail address.  No girl has ever given me a way to contact her, so I'm not sure what this implies. Should I assume that she likes me? Or, is that too presumptuous? Should I send her an e-mail immediately, or wait several days? Is there some kind of proper protocol or code of conduct that you are supposed to follow when a girl has given you her contact info?  She was a really charming girl, and I felt like there was some chemistry between us. However, in the past, every time I ever liked a girl, it was one-sided, so it's hard for me to believe that a girl might actually like me.

ussmv,ussmv,,"And before I get downvoted to oblivion, let me explain. For the first part of knowing each other, we weren't in a relationship in any sense of the word and I knew that. He was my older guy crush in high school (I'm 21, and he's about to turn 23) and when I finally got to hang out with him, I pretty much took what I could get.   After some time progressed and we were still seeing each other, I decided that wasn't enough and we started becoming exclusive, just without a title. We were together every day, on good terms with the others families and went on dates and so on and so forth. We were together for about a year and a half. We then, very abruptly and without warning, stopped speaking and he moved to another state. We talked a few times through two years but with another boyfriend, I didn't know if I wanted to still talk to him.  But every time I thought I didn't want to, I still did. He wasn't clingy or trying to get me to break up with my boyfriend, but he wanted to know about my life and the health of one of my family members who he had become close to. My boyfriend was having none of it, so all talking ceased even though I didn't want that.   A few weeks ago, we got in touch again and talked every day since. He initiates 95% of the conversations. I can't decide if its worth it because I don't want to get hurt again, but we really did have something, and everyone that knows us is totally for it (give or take a few people that have pasts with us)    So the question I pose to you, Reddit, is simple.

That said, if you do get training, it can be a great weapon for defense. It's got a high skill threshhold though before it stops being a liability to your saftey in a fight and becomes a valid tool however. Even getting some proper videos, some trainer blades that match the knife you plan on carrying, and spending some time drilling them would likely help if you have any self defense or martial arts background at all.  Also, my instructor always told me ""If someone introduces a knife to a fight, best case: You both go to the hospital. Worst case: You both go to the morgue. If you get in a knife fight, you WILL get cut.""  I'm weary of mace/OC because it doesn't work if someone is, say, completely blackout drunk, or tweaking on meth, but for other circumstances it's a very good option, and is pretty simple to use. Still try it out on some targets or something a few times, and it wouldn't hurt to get some on your body (not the eyes/nose/mouth unless you're brave) so you can get a feel for how it feels, since if you use it in a fight, chances are you will get some contamination yourself.

2vylsp,2vylsp,aluhvihn,"First of, I know now that this is completely in our wrong and that we should have learned about the parking laws in our area, but the damage is done, and now I'm just hoping someone can help me get out of this pickle.  My girlfriend and I have been living together for two years. In that time, I have been the sole driver, so she has had her car parked at our friend's apartment down the street, since my apartment only gives out one parking spot.  The spot in question where she left her car parked is not a designated parking spot for guests or residents, but just a spot in an alleyway where me and my friends often park. My only point I'm trying to make in this part is that I promise we weren't being rude/inconsiderate to others intentionally, as this is not a high-traffic parking area.  Anyways, it has never been an issue in the past and I guess we just got too comfortable and ended up leaving it there for an extended time now that we have gotten busy.   We decided to finally pick the car up today and discovered it was not there. A few calls here and there and we have now found out that the car was impounded after it was reported as an abandoned vehicle (Not moving it 72 ~~days~~ hours after a parking citation).  Usually we would call it a lesson learned in life but the fee for retrieving the vehicle is $5,000. Frankly, even with my help, that is a whole lot of money that my girlfriend can't afford.  We are curious as to whether or not there is anything we can do to lessen the fees that we are responsible for, and whether or not the fact that she never received any public/official notice of her violation/impound would help us argue that the total fees are unfair since we were not notified that her car had been impounded.

Everything's going great for us, but he is currently living with his mum (he used to share the apartment with a flatmate, but he's moved out since his brother moved in, and his mum moved in as well to keep an eye on the brother) and it's causing some problems.

c2k39zg,kgmaz,karmasutur3,"Ok. So, I would think at your age and experience, your reactions are totally normal and human. So right there we can rule out a few things.   Looks like she has low experience, unless she's hiding something.   Hmmmm. Lots of possibilities, but my initial reaction for a girl who is ugly, 0 of 10 all the way to an 8 of 10 would be that she's seriously insecure about her sexual abilities.   I was with a girl who had only been with one guy (for like 7 years) and she was mentally conditioned to be 'used' to him. And she was AWFUL in bed, in every way. Didn't want it enough, when she did, she was terrible, and said shitty things etc etc.   I really liked her, and over the next two years I was able to pretty much reverse all of that. She just needed to understand that sex is about getting pleasure by enjoying your partner freely, and learning to give and receive.   Like when we first started sleeping together, she never wanted the light on, and when she got turned on she would hurt me. (Like biting way, wayyyyy too hard. ) She did this because her old boyfriend insulted her appearance, and cheated on her, making her feel insecure, and she hurt me because he never made sex noises unless she did, so she was conditioned to think guys liked that. Well, he may have wanted to bleed every time they slept together, But I didn't.   There were a million other little things like that but you get the point. If she has a lack of experience, she might be not doing it so much cause she's afraid of a potential reaction in you that you may not have at all cause it's based on a previous relationship.   That sort of thing, or just fear from inexperience sounds like the case.   There are some other major possibilities.  1. If she's really, really hot, 9 or 10, you may be chasing her too much. Often times you can't chase girls like that. You have to get them to chase you. Not always the rule, but often.   2. She may just have a low libido. Some girls just do.   3. I've come across women who aren't interested in sex because they have never been pleased before. They get some positive feeling during sex , they don't want to be embarrassed, so they label that feeling orgasm. But in reality they have never had one. These girls are easy to spot cause they don't masturbate. You have to make her cum, (no, really) and that fixes this right away.   4. She's uninterested in sex cause you're worse than her last. This means you have to learn.  5. She really, really likes you and is terrified that you're way more experienced than her, and she's trying to keep the contact to a minimum so that you'll stay with her. In this case you have to make it known that sex is an important part of the relationship to you, and that (at this point at least) quantity is more important that quality.   6. She's seeing another dude.     You asked if you should rub one out during cuddling. Nope.  Tell her instead, it's been a while, and you are too turned on to just cuddle. (do this very , very nicely) So you deny the cuddling until you get something. If she says no, don't get mad. If it goes on (no sexual activity) for weeks, then you need to take a stand.   The only difference between boyfriend and friend is one gets sex and the other doesn't. So if she doesn't want you , and doesn't have sexual activity with you, you're not dating. Period.",r

Anyway, depending on your location, you can get a family lawyer to give you a free consult.

So, I think if you can find a way to divide up the chores and spend time with each other every once in a while, you should be just fine :). My bf and I sometimes shower together and, I don't think he realizes it, but that's when we would do a lot of talking.

I am sorry we could not find a solution. As time goes on I want you to reflect on your decision. I want you to think and rethink what you’ve done, not for me but for you. At the end of the day, I truly feel sorry for you. I feel sorry that you never got to experience so many things in your life that most people do. I’m sorry you never got to experience a mother who was capable enough to teach you right from wrong. I am sorry you had a father who used his influence and selfish greed to guide you. I am sorry that you were never able to live your life the way you wanted. Sometimes things in life go your way and sometimes they don’t, its part of life. It is how we adapt and how we carry our selves that make the difference in how we feel.              I said in therapy last summer that maybe I need to be a better son and you need to be a better father. I think on both accounts we failed. Not because there wasn’t the desire to be better but because at the end of the day our definition of what “good” is different. I realize this now because I may not have been a good son to you but to my mother I couldn’t have been better. I had the privilege of learning right from wrong. I had the privilege of being taught to “treat others how you would want to be treated” and to always “help other people no matter what”.  I may have lost a lot in the past couple of weeks. My childhood home that I love very much that provided a secure roof over my head when the world was coming apart, my business that I worked so hard to build and see it falter and fail at the hands of others. But what I haven’t lost and something you can never take away from me is the people that love me for me. The people that have come to support me in my endeavors, the people that can count on me in any situation.  I have lost more in the past 4 years of my life then anyone I know, a mother, a father, an uncle, a grandfather, a house, and a career. At the same time I have gained so much from this experience. I’ve learned how to treat others, I’ve learned to be compassionate no matter what and I’ve learned to stand up for what I believe.  My question to you and I do not expect an answer, are the actions that you are about to take worth it?  Lets take stock of what those consequences will be.  (for arguments sake lets put some realistic dollar amounts on those consequences not all can be reasonably quantified).  -       The loss of two sons (500,000 The cost of upbringing + education)  -       A mother in-law (250,000 This one is incredibly undercut due to a lifetime of knowledge, education and love that she possesses)  -       A brother in-law (250,000 This one is incredibly undercut as well. A person in your life who helped you through your marriage and stood by you)  -       The weddings that you will never see (Priceless)  -       The grandkids you will never get to see and hold (Priceless)  -       The great grandkids you will never get to see and hold (Priceless)  -       The knowledge that future generations will be appalled by your actions (15,000 cost of therapy to get over anxiety)  -       The loss of a reputation that you have worked so hard to build (70,000 x 4 per year in income from a name you built)  -       The loss of happiness that money cannot buy. (Priceless)  -       Knowing that you did not respect your dying wife’s last wishes (unbearably painful and priceless)              You mentioned to Christy once at a meeting that you had that I was “just waiting for someone to die” so that I could collect money. I am saddened to say your evaluation of the way I think is severely flawed. See here’s the thing about last wills and testaments.  They are nothing more then a sheet of paper directing others to hand out the things you can’t take with you when you leave this world. At the end of the day no one remembers you for how much money you have, but how you changed the world. A legacy is almost immediately reduced to bar stories told over drinks and nothing more. How do you want your bar story to read?              There is a limited amount of time to change the world we are only here for a short number of years. It is best not to waist them.  I want to end this with a quote that’s painted onto a wall of a place that I frequent, I think it may be of some use to you in your life. “Anger is one letter short of Danger.”   Goodbye,  Brian",r

meq8h,meq8h,,"So this attractive Japanese foreign exchange student has been giving me what could either be interpreted as signals or friendly gestures for the past few months. I finally decide to go for it, and I tell her that I'm attracted to her at a party. We're both drunk at this point. The interaction goes like this   Her: 'Really?'  Me: 'yes, but I really don't want to make you feel uncomfortable, so if you don't feel the same way I am fine with just being really good friends'.   Her: 'Is there anyone else?'  Me: 'yeah, a couple of people'  She then goes silent, I ask her if she's attracted to anyone in the house, and she says 'I haven't decided yet'. I get her to sit on a couch with me, and a couple minutes later she's leaning on the shoulder of some naked dude while drunkenly grasping at my arm. I then leave because I assumed that I read the signs wrong and she isn't attracted to me.

pb1sz,pb1sz,,"I've been seeing this guy since mid-November and I am absolutely crazy about him. I was aware that he was a bit insecure from the start, but now it's becoming clear that he's completely intimidated by me. He is constantly belittling himself because I'm about to graduate college and he dropped out of college -- but he's got a VERY stable and well-paying job. I find him to be incredibly attractive, but he is constantly saying I'm too pretty for him, et cetera. Last night, I realized just how bad it is.  We were at a bar/restaurant at which I used to waitress, so I knew the bartender. She asked when I would be coming back to work there again and I said it was a possibility that I would work there as I put myself through grad school. Later, boyfriend gets a few beers in him and says he wouldn't want me working there. In his words, ""I'm not telling you what to do, but it would cause a lot of problems."" I literally could not understand why -- this was just a typical pub/grille, not like a Hooters or anything (not that I even find their outfits to be very provocative). I kept asking for an explanation and he kept saying I was naive if I couldn't see for myself. Eventually he just said that he doesn't want his girlfriend around a bunch of drunk guys, and I told him that the job was good money, I will need to pay my bills and I pride myself on my independence. He essentially said that he didn't care.  I also turned 21 a few days ago and I was away at school for my birthday. He works overnights so he couldn't come out with me, but he made sure to guilt-trip the hell out of me.  Both times he had something of a freak-out, which ends in him crying and saying he doesn't want me in situations where guys will be looking at me because I'm too good to be true and I'll find someone better. He told me he literally still gets nervous around me (I have noticed this). I feel the same about him -- he's extremely handsome and I worry that he could do better, but I would never use this as an excuse to restrict him, because I trust him. His apologies are always very sincere, he always regrets the things that he says and tells me he supports me, which makes me think that there is hope for him to lighten up a bit. He also says he worries I'm going to leave him over his confidence/insecurity issues, and quite frankly, I hope it doesn't get to that point, because it would be a possibility.  What do you think guys? Is there a way to make this work? It would kill me to break up with him.",r

After two 6 month leases I got the land lord to start doing a month to month lease because I wanted to keep my options open to find better employment abroad. Six weeks ago I met a woman who was pregnant (I did not know at the time) and she asked if she could use my bathroom. It was the weekend and I had been drinking so I invited her in. After she comes out she wants to watch tv for a while with me and I agree. She eventually asks if she can stay the night, which I am very hesitant because I didn't know her at all and I don't even let tinder dates stay overnight. But she flat out says she'll have sex with me and I agree. I've got a job offer in Texas now and I gave my landlord written notice that I was ending my lease. All of my utilities are normalized in my landlords name so I pay him one price a month for rent/utilities except internet. It was really easy to end the lease and my internet bill was month to month already. I'm not great at good byes and I didn't want her to try and come with me so I left her a note and I got into Texas yesterday with most of my stuff and I'm staying with family currently, I start on the 24th which is next Wednesday I believe. I've heard of ""residency"" issues and I'm worried she might claim the child to be mine. We were ever in a relationship or anything, just FWB at best. What should I be concerned about?",l

My father in law is in the process of moving close to me and my husband. He is currently 2-2:30 hours away.  &gt;  &gt; He had been pre-approved, had a house under contract and was going to close in about 2 weeks.  &gt;  &gt; He had a old family friend helping pack up his house for like $10 an hr since my husband and I could only go up every other weekend or so and we bring a toddler so we aren't the most efficient when up there.  &gt;  &gt; Anyway, this woman spent weeks grooming him about all these bad breaks she has had, abusive ex, custody battle, awful family life, etc. Then three weeks ago she came to him hysterical about needing a car and helping getting a loan. The deal was she would always make the payments.  &gt;  &gt; Somehow they ended up at a dealership and got a $25,000 new car. Two weeks later my father in law found out he no longer qualifies for his mortgage because of his debt to income ratio.  &gt;  &gt; He told the woman this and asked she refi the car and get a consigner. She couldn't get one. He asked her to bring the car back so he could sell it back and move forward with his mortgage. She said she would, then no showed. He even said if she brought the car back he would get her a $7,000 used car so he could get this mortgage. This was a lie, but a attempt to get the car back. She told him to stop harassing her and stopped all contact.  &gt;  &gt; She led him to believe she worked for the school system which is why she was off all summer and listed the high school on the contract. Today I called to verify this and she no longer works there. She is unemployed.  &gt;  &gt; My father in law is the primary owner, she is also listed on the loan as a cosigner and on the title.  &gt;  &gt; Since the loan is so new she hasn't technically missed a payment yet. But my father in law has a key and is a legal owner. Tomorrow the plan is to go track her down and take the car. We will not take the car from her property. She posts a lot to Facebook so we hope to figure out her whereabouts that way. We hope to take it from a parking lot and be gone before she knows.  &gt;  &gt; We plan on immediately over nighting any personal items to her and video taping the process of packing everything.  &gt;  &gt; Now we will probably have to have her signature to sell it since it is in titled in both names but I don't see that happening with how things have gone.  &gt;  &gt; Can we get in trouble for taking the car? My father in law will drive it away. Any legal filings we should make to get her removed from the title/force the sale? Anything else we should do to protect ourselves? I did call the sheriffs office. They will not get involved because it is civil matter at this point.  &gt;  &gt; Yes I know my father in law made a terrible decision and he will lose some money on this. He hasn't bought a house in 30 yrs and his wife handled all the bills and stuff. We are trying to get this resolved quickly so he can move. We are trying to get him away from these people and down here closer to us. A few months ago some cousin came to him upset she needed money for bail for her son and her lights were about to be turned off. Luckily he only lost a few hundred there.",l

kxy71,kxy71,girladvice,"Hi, so here's my situation. Essentially I met a girl a few weeks back at a coffee shop and after chatting a bit I asked for her number, which she seemed happy to supply. Two weeks later we met up and I showed her around (she's new to the city). Anyways she seemed to really like me (laughed at my shitty jokes, made lots of eye contact, smiled, happy). Anyways, more importantly, I really liked her. I have met very few people who I was able to talk with after just meeting a few times with no awkward pauses or anything. And I was attracted to even fewer of them.  So after we parted ways I sent her a text the next day saying I had fun, she replied saying she did too. I called her a few days after that (got her answering machine), asked if she was busy this saturday (today). She responded saying she was really busy but if she had free time she'd let me know (she is legitimately busy as we're both doing our PhDs). So needless to say she didn't text today, which is fine I'm not upset or anything. But the main problem is I don't really know how to proceed from here.   I've really tried to come off as not needy or anything (and in all honesty I really am not, but I am a bit lonely and I did really like her) so I don't text her or anything outside of asking her out.

rz80i,rz80i,,"Hello [/r/relationshipsdvice](/r/relationshipsdvice) . I come seeking your collective wisdom and insight.  For the past few days I have been fixated on this woman my age(both 21) from my town. We met on okcupid one night where we chatted for four hours over the IM. From that conversation we discussed general interests, how rude some of the guys messaging her, and her arousal/frustration.  The last part threw me for a loop(virgin/SAP) but I did my best to seem confident and do some light teasing to help her along.  That first night ended with the exchanging of phone numbers for texting purposes.  After the second day of talking I invited her out for food but she had reservations. Apparently the last guy she had met had forced himself on her accused her of leading him on.  This was all cool with me because I was enjoying her conversation as much as I would anything physical.  The third day she opens up to me about how emotional she is feeling.  Both because that guy that almost forced himself on her was cussing her out and another guy she was talking to before me on okcupid has apparently started ignoring her. I did my best to lend support without white-knighting too hard, I believe this was her testing me.  Last night she once again shared that she was horny and we sexted a bit.  My question is if in a relationship where she like this if I should let her set the pace. She seems to have a lot on her mind and is making the conversations more and more personal, escalating on her own, but slowly.  I'm fine with this. I just don't want her to get bored of me because I didn't ask her out again after her showing reservation the first time.",r

The better choice would be to end it, try to remain friends, and then see if you two could have a relationship again in two years.  If he is open to a long distance relationship then to deal with him seeing other women, and you with other men I assume, you have to realize that we all have needs.

Experiencing neck/back/head problems couple of days afterward.** &gt;Last weekend my landlord decided to put up a wrought iron fence around the parkway (the green grass area between the street and the building). The workers that they hired apparently didn't measure correctly and dug holes for the post to close to the street. She came over and instructed them to remove the post and then left for the weekend. I was outside on Friday and spoke with her about the plans to redo the parkway after the workers had left. Her husband was here all weekend working in the basement which is his workshop. They were aware of the holes and left them all weekend. The school across the street uses our side as a loading zone and luckily school just got out for them a day earlier or this would have happened to one of them.  &gt;  &gt; On Monday I went to Ikea and came back home and started unloading the car. I was carrying an Ikea box and my left leg went all the way down the hole. I don't recall exactly how I fell, but have pictures of the injuries to my leg, knees, feet, and thighs. One of their workers saw me fall and didn't come over to help. He just stared at me. So I have him as a witness if needed. I immediately took photos of the holes and then went straight to the doctor. While I was waiting for the doctor, I emailed her and let her know of the situation. She apologized and admitted that the holes should have been covered and offered to pay for my medical bill for that one visit. The holes were then immediately filled by someone while I was at the doctor. My wife took photo's of them filling up the holes. Now a couple days afterward I have had neck/lower back/head problems associated with the fall. Extreme vertigo, cloudiness, lower skull and neck pain, and my right hand and foot are experiencing numbness with pins and needles.  &gt;  &gt; I've lived with the landlords for two years and have had my share of problems with them, but we weren't planning on moving because my wife is 5 months pregnant and we have a 8 month old baby. I had just carried the baby up previously before returning to the car to finish unloading. I'm not sure if I should obtain a lawyer merely for the fact to protect myself because my Dr. wants me to have a couple of scans done and this could get expensive. I tried working last week, but with the cognitive issues I wasn't able to get much done. The landlords aren't bad people, but they are just really old and cheap in nature. I'm not sure what is fair here and would like to  deal with them rather than obtaining counsel. However, my family and my wife's families says otherwise.",l

I have a question though -- like I said in the other post I'm a geeky, Aspergery sort of personality and I've been wondering ... *why do I care* when she says the hateful things she says?  Obviously, it's very important that she not say them in front of our son because he's five and can't judge for himself, and we have made a little progress with that. It happens less.  But ignoring our son for a second, why exactly do I get so upset and angry when says things which are just nuts.  For instance, my father is coming to stay with us. We agreed to pay his fare as long as it was under $1,000. Last time she lost it, she 'withdrew' that consent in the sense of pretending she never gave it. ""I never said your father could visit!"" she yells ""call him now, tell him he can't come!"".  So at that point, I argue, like a logical, normal person. I point out the ticket is non-refundable, I tell her of course she agreed -- I can't even spend *five* dollars without checking with her first, let alone a thousand -- I point out that our son would be terribly upset. I point out that it's 3 AM where my father lives so even if I was going to call I wouldn't do it now.  But my question is, why do I even bother? Why do I respond? What she's saying is clearly nuts, and she's just saying it to hurt and upset me. Why do I get into a conversation with a completely irrational person?

CPS is involved.   &gt;  &gt; Backstory: The mother of my child and I have been separated since before her birth. I have been 110% involved since she was born. I filed for custody, volunteered to sign myself up for child support payments, created our court enforced visitation schedule.  &gt;  &gt; I have my daughter roughly 40% of the time and 50% custody. Her mother has always had a huge issue with this and has spent the last 2 years trying to alienate my daughter from me by either taking her away from me or through other means like teaching her to call her step dad daddy and telling her she doesn't need to be around me and my wife.  &gt;  &gt; Just like week she reported to CPS that she thought I was sexual abusing my daughter. CPS interviewed and examined my daughter and me. They have since allowed me to continue to get my daughter at my scheduled times, but told me the investigation is still on going. The mother has since continued to threaten me by saying she will not drop the issue and will see to it that she gets my daughter.  &gt;  &gt; For reference: my daughter's mother is not the best mom by a long shot. She has done many of things that would deem her a bad parent even excluding the alienation and false accusations. She is very hostile to me  at every opportunity.  &gt;  &gt; How can I not only protect myself, but also her? &gt;  &gt; What do I need to do?",l

msbb3,msbb3,BFsExGF,"I met the 'man of my dreams' about a month ago, everything has been wonderful and we've been getting to know each other, dating, just enjoying the beginnings of what will likely turn into a relationship.  We've had a few discussions on our recent past relationships.  His was a 14 month relationship that ended somewhere around September.  He left work early one evening and she thought he wouldn't be home until late- ended up coming home drunk with some dude.  Later admitted she'd been cheating.  Guy I'm dating said a lot about how he would never do that to someone and how hurt he was that she did that.  I have also never cheated but have been cheated on, so we're on the same page with understanding the feelings involved with it.  Now to the fun part.  He told me he's been talking to the ex and that he wants to have a friendship with her.  He also said that in the past 2-3 months since they broke up she's been begging for him back.  He said he won't take her back.  My thoughts are that I don't care if they are friends but that it's unhealthy for me and for him to be involved with her if that's what she's trying to do.  I understand that he's not my boyfriend but I want to pursue furthering our relationship without rocky waters from anyone else.  Is 2-3 months past a 14 month relationship too soon for them to attempt a friendship while she's begging for him back and he's pursuing a relationship with me?  Thoughts, reddit?",r

1tz9lo,1tz9lo,,"So I'm a sophomore in high school and i'm a guy... I don't even know where to begin with this... but I might as well just start. I'm going to use just the first letter of each of the people in this events name. So I was at one of my friends house for a bonfire party like type of thing last saturday night and here's where this starts. I show up with my friend ""A"" to this since my parents were driving me and him. When we got there, we had realized that everyone was downstairs so when we go down to the basement we find them playing ping pong and my other friends were gathered around. There was the host ""D"" a good friend of mine and there were others about 8 others along with only two but well known girls in our social circle they will be called ""T"" and ""E"". E is two years older than everyone else there (She's a senior) but T and E are best friends. Later on though another girl named M showed up. (I'll just throw out there that T and D are exs and so are A and M but they've totally gotten over each other and act very naturally around each other. Also let it be known that there was something developing between D and E because D really started to act flirtatious with E for the past few weeks) So initially at the bonfire, everything was cool. The food was great and we had a once time around the fire and everything.Then we all got the idea that we should go outside and and just walk around the neighborhood or go to the woods or something because it was dark (around 7 pm but it gets really dark fast here at this time of the year) So we all went outside and had a good time. We went to these woods and a great scare. but then... we went to this small park in the neighborhood. Nobody was there of course because it was ridiculously dark by then. there were some swings that a few people went on. There was a tiny slide that nobody fit on obviously and then there was on of those combo slide set things with a tube connecting to halves of it. i was uninterested and went and sat on in of the slide set thing. Soon after, T joins me and we were just sitting there. And next, S, who is D's little bother shows up there also with M. And we were just casually talking. Soon everybody else came there and we started talking about sex which we casually and maturely talk about because its exciting and everybody likes talking about these things like masturbation, erections, and other such topics... which is all very fine and dandy. But then when E came to this place in the slide set (it was already very crowded there) I had to make room for her so she could sit. Since I was sitting at the entrance to a tube i just went farther into this tube and lied down on my belly so my head was the only thing poking out of the entrance to the tube facing my friends sitting squished together but that was fine with us. Soon though, our conversation gently drifted in away when finally it built up to he point where A said "" hey we should like take turns making out in the tube just as friends. I was silently really fond of that idea since i'm just a teenage boy with raging hormones. But I'm generally not known as the one thats likely to get girls in our circle of friends because out of my friends who were there who were A,D,and C (who's this really hyper kid thats really immature but we all act like we are responsible like a parent to him because he's short and cute) A and D have had plenty of relationships  and I've had only had like 1 and im fine with that along with the fact that I'm not known for being one to be good with girls. Strangely though, that night I felt empowered. Anyway, We all laughed at A's idea but then we realized he was serious. A said since im already in the tube I should go first. S, eeny meeny mineey moed which of the 3 girls (T,M, or E) had to go. The girls were fine to this idea in fact they were actually way more excited then most everyone else for this. It landed on M but she was still in disbelief though that we were actually doing this (but not in a way as to not want to make out). So she confirmed with me if this was serious and i said apparently so to not sound desperate. I asked A if he could make sure nobody would watch. So E got in and We confirmed one last time and then we just had an extremely blissful time making out. I'm not joking that girl is a ridiculously aggressive kisser and i really enjoyed it. It was like full on tongue and at the end I felt so empowered and i just felt amazing. At the end, E said that was really fun and that i was a great kisser which i never imagined in a million years that i was. Annoyingly though in the middle, C kept on shining his phone flash light into the tube exposing us to everyone claiming ""he was just making sure that we were in fact making out"". anyway afterwards, A wanted his turn so i got out and he got in. But then for some reason the others made him get out and said I should go for round 2. I was pretty excited for this and the next girl to come in was T who i'm slightly more attracted to (but she doesn't know that). And then when she got in, we made out. and it once again felt fantastic but we were  forced to cut it short because her hair was going down the through and causing me to have a gag reflex (embarrassing i know right?) but anyway she was cool with it. When I got out I was breathing heavily and everybody had a friendly giggle about it. I said i needed some time alone so i went by the mini slide that was a few meters away from the slide set and the tube. But i said that everyone else should carry on though. But E went off the slide set and became concerned asking if i was alright ad everything. I said I was alright and everything was fine but for some reason E felt that we should stop so the girls and the other guys who were disappointed (especially A) went off to go sit in that grass. i climbed down from the ming slide and just as I did T came and stretched her arms out as to hug me  and said ""that was nice"". and i hugged her back (just as friends also) and said that was amazing but she was like whoa what!?!? and i realized that she had in fact wanted to make out with me further and so we did standing up by the slide away from the others until M came by and and put her arms around both us while our faces were literally like still in each other. When she did we stopped so that we didn't seem rude and then we walked toward the swings where on the way T said wow.. that was amazing... me and you should like make out in the library alone some time. And I said we should. E said that this friends with benefits thing would be a good idea for relieving stress and while she said that. T grabbed my hand and started pulling me toward the tube again. Me, excited as usual went along with it. When we climbed upto the tube I said ladies first so she could get into the tube to be a gentlemen but she had other plans. T said I should go first because she wanted to be on top. I'm like wow that would be amazing and so I got in and she got on top of me and then we made out again for the 3rd and final time and this was the best time. Really the most enjoyable experience I had ever had. In the middle she stopped to say ""oh and feel free to grab my ass which was amazing because I had never grabbed another girls ass before and The entire experience was just amazing. just the two of us in a tube with her on top of me making out. We eventually stopped and then we all walked back to D's House but on the way back A put his arm around D and tried to form a ""forever alone bros"" sort of thing.. but i actually felt really awkward too go near them though because they had witnessed me immensely make out with their very lose friends of theirs and mine and also i knew that nothing would be the same ever again between everyone there but we tried to act normal. when we got back, we sat around the bonfire and A tried to start a game of spin the bottle but that was stopped because the girls wanted homosexual kissing to be allowed while the guys didn't. I respectfully got out of the game because I said that I had my share already. But the spin the bottle never happened nor did anymore kissing that night. after this though I felt really empowered and proud that I had accomplished such a feet but then I began to feel extremely guilty because I felt that i had offended D, for kissing the girl he had a crush on (E) as though it was no big deal, without him ever having to express his feelings for her. I also felt that I had committed offense to A because he was so excited to kiss someone but never got a chance that night. And also offense to C because I feel really fatherly towards him despite him being my friend (he's really immature though) but I had to make him watch me make out with girls while he's never even kissed anyone and has really wanted his first kiss... so yeah thats my story... I just feel like I had to throw that out there...",r

She proceeded to call tiredness on the night, I said okay but she sat up texting her friends and checking that awful social networking site whilst I sat their like a twat. I called her on it and she brushed it aside like she has done before on lesser occasions, but got pissy with me. We resumed like nothing had happened the next day, back to the awesome relationship.

When we got in from the gig, she told me to 'stop taking this relationship so seriously', and then just carried on like nothing happened, leaving me to say that she can't just drop serious statements and not expect a response. I suggested a week apart to give each other some room to breathe, then she dropped the bombshell that maybe we'd work out better as friends as I was walking out of her door. I told her that we would talk about this after the week apart as I really want to make this work; she said she doesn't want to stop talking to me completely for the week, but wants to see how this goes. I told her there and then that friends can't work for me, but we'd see how this week goes, and had to leave.  I am at a loss because I don't want to lose this girl, but I cannot keep her as a friend because it has never worked out before for me, and I personally cannot be friends with somebody who tells me they love me and has already planned so much for the moths ahead for us two (including her actually buying gig tickets, making enquiries about holidays etc.). I don't see this going any other way then me being dumped the fuck out of. Any thoughts or comments would be a big help to a clueless guy.",r

You are working with private information in the insurance field, and there's going to be 1000's of people like this. Your company has a process for this, they have lawyers that work out all the details, they have computer data systems to identify things, and if you stray from your duties you might open yourself up to very serious civil action from your employer.  Your job requires a dispassionate attention to detail, rules, and regulations.    If you feel like you need to be a champion above and beyond what the company itself is willing to do, you're going to die on that hill. Their job is to provide insurance or deny it, etc. not to police people with their data.

She eventually rejected him because she fell for me instead. It's been several weeks since she told me her feelings but I can't really figure out what to do. I'm still conflicted on if I truly like her or if I only feel conflicted because of the guilt for the pain I will cause my friend. Going for the same girl that your friend goes for is definitively a dick move. So at this point, I don't know I should do. Should I just follow my feelings and in the process cause pain for my friend and probably lose a friend. Or should I just accept the fact that I can't, morally, date her because I don't want to do that to a close friend. It just feels so unfair to me that I can't date her because of that.

He was a very young kitten and was injured. I caught him, brought him home and took him to the vet the next day. He needed to have surgery which the vet did for free because I couldn't afford it. I did have to pay a few small fees but that's it. &gt;   &gt; I was living at home with my parents at the time, but my ex had moved in and helped take care of the kitten while I was att worked. Essentially, my ex was lazy and wouldn't find a job, and was disrespectful so my mom told me we had to leave. This was one of MANY red flags but I was enamored. &gt;  &gt; Fast forward to today. We married three years ago and now I'm filing for divorce. He lied to me about finances, got his car repossessed, and was emotionally abusive/unavailable. Our cat is four years old. When I went to pick up the cats (there's two), the apartment reeked of smoke, my ex had been binge drinking for who knows how long, and he hadn't showered in a week. I took the cats and they've been with me since. He did not put up a fight. Then he moved to out of state to live with his rich grandmother. I sent divorce papers a few weeks ago. &gt;  &gt; Now, I have always told my ex that he could visit the cat. But he blew up on me on one occasion and called me a slut (which he later apologized for). Another time I said he couldn't see the cat was when he confessed to having oral sex with a 16 year old girl when he got to his grandmother's state. I have this confession over text but other than that, no proof. He talked about the poor girl like she is garbage. My ex is 22 by the way. &gt;  &gt; So now he has been threatening to take me to court if I do not give him the cat. We both raised the cat but I'm the one who adopted him and took him to the vet before we were married, so does that make him mine by default? My ex has been extremely nasty with me, saying he has a lawyer, saying he has nude and embarrassing photos of me, saying he could easily ruin my life. He says that once I give him the cat, my ex will visit our home state and bring the cat with him. I don't want this because I think traveling for hours every month would be too stressful for my kitty. My ex has friends here that he'll be seeing. It makes more sense to me that I keep the cat and he visits when he's in town. I also do not want to separate my two cats. They love each other to death and I know they would miss each other. &gt;  &gt; So yeah, do I have more rights than my ex when it comes to ownership? I honestly don't even think he has a lawyer. I think he's just trying to intimidate me and thinks I'm an idiot. What should my next course of action be? I really do not want to go to court and have my cat taken from me. I just want my life back. Every lawyer I've spoken to had said 1. The cat is mine by default since I rescued him before we were married and 2. There's a chance my ex's case won't even make it to court. But, we did raise him together and equally. Please, please help and let me know what my options are. I can't afford a lawyer and I don't want my time to be wasted even more. &gt;  &gt; tl;dr  My ex husband is threatening to take me to court for custody of our cat. I rescued the cat before we were married but we've raised him together. What can I do to get this asshole off my back?",l

For the past 6 months I have been concerned that I am not able to experience life to the fullest. Immediately before dating my current boyfriend, I was in a 2 year relationship. I just feel like my entire adult life will be spent with another human being at my side, influencing my thoughts and actions. I don't feel inhibited, like there are things I wish I could do but can't because I'm in a relationship. I just think if we were separate, I would have a better self-realization and I really think that he would too. I love my boyfriend, I don't want to feel this way, I wish so much that I could ignore this burning desire to experience independence.   My doubts of our relationship have been affecting our entire relationship. We have not been having sex as frequently as we used to. I have been fantasizing sexually about other people, including co-workers. I don't enjoy the way he smells. He does not smell bad, I used to love the way he smells, but now I avoid his breath at all cost. I get very short with him, arguing at little things, and I try not to, but I lack proper emotional control.   We fell in love very fast and have had rough times throughout our relationship, going to different schools for a period of time and dealing with my depression. He is moving out of our place for an internship for 3 months.

Previously, (after marriage, before baby) I caught him sexting with a woman in another state. As far as I know, this has been the only instance of infidelity. There was a confrontation, an extremely serious and emotion discussion, and promises of it never happening again. I made sure he broke it off with her in my presence, and to my knowledge, there has been no contact.  This has been over a year and a half ago. Now, I can't stop subconsciously thinking he's going to cheat on me again. I don't think about it all the time, and I don't often get jealous or paranoid about female coworkers or friends, but when I least expect it, my feeling of distrust bubble up to the surface. For instance, I dreamt he cheated on me last night. It was incredibly real: took place in my home, with someone I knew, and in the dream I decided to leave, which involved our child and my family. I woke up in tears, of course he wanted to know what happened in the dream, so I told him. Now he feels terrible that these feeling are buried inside me and that he is the cause of my paranoia. I feel terrible, because I genuinely want to trust him and give him the benefit of the doubt.   I feel like I'm going crazy. I don't want to be paranoid anymore, or continue having these dreams. He made a mistake in the past, we dealt with it, and now it's over. Since then he's been the best husband and father any woman could want.

I had never had a serious sexual relationship before hand.  So, recently I found out that my boyfriend has been watching a lot of porn. This bothers me for two reasons:  1.	He watches it on days when I come over,which wouldn’t bother me except that it often results in us not having sex. This means our sex life has been greatly hampered. I understand it’s been a long relationship, but I have been trying and he often just turns me down.  2.	I have a lot of self esteem issues pertaining to sex (not that I am bad in bed) and this has only heightened them. I feel useless and uncomfortable about my body, which is something I had never had with him before. I want very badly to be able to fulfill as many of his sexual desires as possible, but he doesn’t tell me about them, so what can I do?  I’ve never had to deal with porn before. I’m at a loss here. How do I tell him it really hurts me without infringing on his sexual needs?

c3szxup,pqrzw,Newtothis720,I got married last April. I had been with him for over 4 years when we were married. I started to feel weird about being married probably 6 months before the wedding. I spoke to one of my friends who was married and she told me she felt the same way. She told me the moment she was standing at the alter she knew it was right. That comment got me through the next 6 months to my wedding day. But then as I stood at the alter looking at him all I could think was that I was making a mistake. I thought it was too late at the point so I went through with it. 6 weeks after we were married I found out he had been seeing prostitutes from Craigslist during out entire relationship.   So I say go with your gut. If it tells you this isn't right LiSTEN. If you think its jist nerves then i wish thrn stick with it. That's the biggest lesson I've learned during my  situation.

Especially if you're not a naturally 'chatty' person. Any emotions seem to be multiplied by 1200 when you can't physically be with the person, don't fall into that. This was a big problem for me, because I would ask him things about his plans for the day or what he did at work or how he felt about whatever, and dismissing it was the worst possible thing he could do. Don't do that. * **Include**: Remember you're a couple. Even if you can't be with one another physically, keep her in mind as often as possible. Don't hide details about what your plans are or who you're with. I know it can feel invasive at times, but it's like stage theatre: your acting and makeup, or love for her, has to be more dramatic so that she can see it from allllll the way where she is. Tell her things about your friends, take pictures when you go places and email them to her when you get home. * **Romance**: You forget how much a hug or loving look can fix. Emotions surface and there's no way to deal with them. Both of you should try your best to help the other person remember how much you love them.

4ddkve,4ddkve,bronze_queen,"Hi Like mentioned above this incident has occurred in New York City, NY, USA. Thank you so much for any advice.  So back in February of 2015 I moved into an apartment in Brooklyn to take over a lease for a girl who was moving out (I was there 7 out of the 12 months for the lease after she moved). When I moved in, the lease was changed to include my name instead of the previous girl. So along with my name on the lease three other individuals were on it who rented out the other three rooms.  As stated in the lease, the rent for the apartment was to be paid in full altogether. That is, if one roommate did not pay we were all responsible for the unpaid rent. In hindsight of course it would have been smart to make the payment on one check from all of us but since we all had hectic schedules and scarcely saw each other we paid our individual rent for our rooms and sent separate checks to the management company.   Fast forward to the beginning of September of 2015, in which I had just moved to a new apartment with one other roommate (I will call her Susan) from this old apartment I got along with.   Suddenly I get a call from a former roommate (for anonymity I will him Giovanni). Giovanni is from Italy and was moving back in a week and called the management company to get his security deposit back. He told me they were not going to give it back because our apartment had an accrued debt of $5200.  Completely shocked since I had paid my rent every month and my roommates too expressed shock. We all told the management company we had records of our payments and would give them to the management company to prove all payments were made. We were also irritated that the management company had let a debt of $5200 accrue without notifying us once.  The other of the three roommates (let's call him Mike) said he had proof of payment through pay stubs his mother made and would provide them to management within the following week.  A week passes by and no word of the pay stubs. Susan and I ask Mike again when he is going to provide evidence of payments to the management company. He says he is going to report to their office the next day to show the evidence. FYI, I have proof of all this correspondence through email.  Week after week Mike makes no effort to resolve this issue. Meanwhile, the management company sends us a tabulated sheet of all payments paid and unpaid from month to month and we see Mike did not pay for 6.5 months of rent. We figure out that these pay stubs that Mike claims ""he could not find"" when supposedly searching for them must not have existed to begin with.  Since at this point Mike does not respond to my or any of the other roommates texts and calls I constantly correspond with the management company. I eventually find out that he agreed to a payment plan with them that would require he pay the debt off in 7 months. Basically paying his original rent price of $800 every month for which he did not pay.   I call later in January to see if Mike is making his payments. He made payments for October and November but never paid December. As time goes on I find in February his last payment was still in November.  At this point I ask the management company what is going to happen and they said they have contacted the NYC debt collectors dept. They reassure me that they will likely go just after Mike since the evidence proves he is responsible for accruing the debt. If he does not pay, the management company said that on matters like this in the past the other roommates then have to pay the debt.   My question is, aren't they supposed to go after Mike's guarantor for HIS unpaid rent? (his guarantor is his mother). I understand that we were altogether on the lease, but what is the point of having each renter provide a guarantor when the guarantor apparently does not seem responsible for Mike while Susan and I would have to pay off Mike's debt?  I went to a legal clinic recently and the lawyer said I could take Mike to small claims court. I would have to list Mike as the first defendant and then the management company as the second. I would be suing Mike to get my security deposit back (i.e. him paying $850 since that is the amount still with held in my security deposit). She said that the court would likely drop the management company as the second defendant and just go after Mike. I am scared though that they could still include the management company as a defendant and then I will have to battle with the management company's attorney.  The lawyer also said it was odd that the management company contacted the NYC debt collectors dept because that will probably mean they are making a claim against all of us.  Because of this I am still afraid of what will result from their investigation. With this unpaid debt Susan and I are afraid that it will affect our credit and our guarantor's credit score. Since Giovanni is back in Italy this probably won't affect him.   My question is, can I still take Mike to small claims court to show how he is responsible for my not being able to get my security deposit back? If I win, he would have to pay me $850 while having still owing the management company 3600.  My second question is, does anyone on here have experience with the NYC debt collectors dept? What will likely happen when they investigate this matter?  Also, just to add to Mike's character apparently when he moved into his new spot with friends one of his friends had to bail him out when he ""could not"" pay rent for a month. He later lost his job due refusing less pay when the company had cutbacks and is now a server in NYC and living with his Mom. A class A act -_-",l

clmxyps,2kna8o,Lynn_L,"&gt;so hostile work environment is when your coworker is making sexual comments.  No...it's when your co-worker is harassing you so badly and so often that it effectively changes the terms of your employment.  It has to be horrible, and persistent.  &gt;you're saying it has to be proven in court that said sexual harrassers were doing it, and not just once, and for that, it has to be documented.  I'm saying you need evidence.  &gt;one of the things i've been neglecting is reporting everytime because i feel like a tattletale. only reporting when it personally happens to me.  You can only recover in court for harassment that happens to you.  Harassment that happens to others may or may not be admissible in court.  These are all good things to discuss with your lawyer.

1rwpuq,1rwpuq,,"Boyfriend (25) and I (23) have even dating since September 2011 (so a bit over 2 years).  We met through mutual friends while I was in college and while he had just graduated.  We have been long distance the entire time, separated by a 2 hour drive. We saw each other most weekends, and now see each other most of the week (I drive to his apartment on Thursday and leave Monday morning for school). But it has come to my attention recently that he really does not want to live with me any time soon. Which is a little odd for me as I would be ready to move in with him tomorrow.  He claims that he feels like his 20s are for living with friends. And he has made it clear that it would be years before he would be ready to take our relationship to that next step.  I understand his fears, but at the same time if I am true to myself - I feel like waiting so long will not make me happy and may cause me to resent. I would be living by myself, living in a city just because of the fact that he lives there, while he lives with his friends. And I don't know what to do.  Do I just hang on and hope he will change his mind? That in a year he will be ready to make that final step with me?  I love him so very much and I do know that I would not meet anyone like him. But as I'm applying for jobs I'm reaching this critical decision point where I could either make all my decisions based on him and his location, or venture out to other places, other states.   I want us both to be happy. He deserves happiness. We've been through hell and back, supporting, crying, and laughing along the way. And in an ideal world, id want it to be us, together.

117x8q,117x8q,,"Before hand- I really would like honest help not to be criticized for who you believe I am. I've been burned before on here.   I (34/f)am a stay at home of four. SO (34/m)is the sole bread winner by choice. We have discussed me getting a job, but if I did it would mean alot of the things I do now would have to be done by someone else and , quite frankly, no one is willingly to step up.  THE PROBLEM My SO makes a 6 figure income. I am given an allowance of $300 a week. This is for food (for 6 people), household items/paper products, gas, and since it is my allowance if I need a hair cut or clothing, I use this money. I used to have $400 budgeted and our budget needed reworking so I was cut down to $300. I do everything I can to save money. I coupon, research, compare and price match.  I am the only one getting the kids to all of their activities. During the week, I make supper at 2 so I can get everyone fed and where they need to be. Most nights I get home around 8:30. I am exhausted all the time, some physically but mostly emotionally.   SO seems to constantly complain about money I may spend. I try to explain how the cost of everything has went through the roof but he doesn't listen. If I cook hamburger helper he complains about feeding the family crappy meals. He complains if he doesn't think I cook enough food at a meal.   I many times end up in tears.  I will ask for help cleaning the kitchen up because I have to have someone somewhere at a certain time and he will not help.   I don't go out shopping and buying nice clothes. I don't get mani pedis, or my hair done. I don't go anywhere I don't absolutely have to in order to save gas.   SO went out and bought a new car not long ago even though the one he had was payed for, so now there's a car payment. He has ""projects"" he spends money on but I'm buying myself a t-shirt at the local goodwill.   I truly think he believes that I don't know what I'm talking about when I ask for help, or tell him how little money I have to spend on things. He thinks I'm just being emotional or exaggerating. I've tried to talk to him but he gets defensive and shuts down. Please don't say go to counseling. We've tried it in the past and it wasn't something that helped me in any way. It was literally me saying something, the counselor repeating it to my SO, and him saying oh ok I didn't know that. Without getting into details, I got burned and don't want to be anywhere near anyone that is in that profession for their own safety.   Q:am I being unrealistic about budgeting needs for a family of 6? $300  -70 for gas $230  -50 for household/cleaning/hygiene/paper products $180 For food for 1 week for 6, ( no fish sticks, hamburger helper) And any hair cuts or clothing I need out of this money.   Q:short of leaving, how can I end this cycle of being taken for granted?  Q:",r

kgnpj,kgnpj,,"I'm not really sure how to word this, or even what to do... But here goes... I dated this girl for 4 years, since I was 18, really nice girl actually, really caring, she had a few issues though, very possessive, very jealous of my other female friends, hated my male friends, but our relationship was pretty good for about a year, after that, we got into several fights, more so over this female friend of mine, we'll call her J, who was my best friend before I even met said gf...  Anywho, I decided to end the relationship as it wasn't working out, I stopped loving her, I felt terrible that I did, one night I went out, got extremely drunk and picked up... No sex, just hooking up... Feeling mega guilty I broke it off that week with her, she was in hysterics, called/texted me daily begging me to take her back, this went on for 3 weeks, I wasn't seeing anyone at the time and agreed to get back with her if we worked on a few things... Her possessiveness and jealousy mainly...  We got back together, dated for another year, same thing happened, I got drunk, picked up again, deja vu... Broke up again... She knew everything about what happened, things got a little bit further than just a kiss, begged me to take her back... We were split for a month, once again, I agreed to get back with her again, this lasted 2 more years before one night I went out with friends, got drunk and hooked up with J, my best friend, she told me all these things of how she had been waiting for me and she was in love with me and she was waiting for things to end with me and gf, I always liked her, way before I even met said gf, so I broke up with the gf, started dating J, ex gf got really really upset, begged and begged for 3 months, me and J ended up mutually braking things off, mainly because the ex was very threatening towards J, sending her messages and telling her she'll get screwed over... We had a smooth breakup, no hurt feelings, still best friends...  This led my ex to believe I'd take her back again, I told her no chance, I've moved on, I had my own problems to fix, I was a serial cheater and didn't love her. Anyway, 1st ex starts dating new guy... He seems cool, I was happy for her and happy not being tied down anymore... They've been together for 4 months now, I've also just started seeing someone else, but my ex is cockblocking me by repeatedly calling/texting me while i'm out with new girl, new girl is really put off by this and is kinda worried about the frequency of it... She sends me messages daily wanting to meet up, missing me, loves me etc... She's seeing someone else and I feel terrible for the guy... Basically I want to know, should I confront him about what she says to me? Ignore her messages? Should I at least try and stay friends with her? Keeping in mind, she constantly sends me facebook messages, text messages, phonecalls...   TLDR; I cheated on my girlfriend 3 times, we broke up 7 months ago, I've moved on, she still wants to get back together, she's also seeing someone new while telling me she still wants me and loves me... This creeps the new girl I'm seeing out... Should I talk to her current bf and tell him what ex says to me? Stay friends with ex? Ignore her completely?

15l83x,15l83x,,"Ok so rewind to October, I meet a cashier at a local restaurant chain in downtown Miami. I'm from Venezuela, and she's from Spain, we hit it off on a date, and from that date we were and (still are unseparable, even our best friends hit it off). I went to her roommate's house bunches of times... We have been having lots of sex and share a lot of feelings with each other, just a generally healthy relationship. 2 weeks after she gets hired at the corporation and is doing very well as a marketing coordinator in Miami, obviously she is a college graduate, and very pretty. She picks me up from work, pays for my food (when i let her) she met my family and gets along with all my friends. And all around positive and great person. It should be noted that I usually have to borrow my parents car to go out with her. She does not mind at all and loves to spend tome with me, texts me everyday, I felt elated because i've never had a girl this attracted to me.   Fast forward 2 weeks later and at a dinner I see a weird text message from a guy and it turns out that it is her Ex and they still text almost every day with cutesy messages.  He cheated on her four times, during their 3 year relationship in college (she already graduated). I ended the outing very angry, and she understood. Then every other time we hung out I had jealousy problems. This became a problem, and she accomodated for it: She let me read all her texts. Facebook etc. which I do, even though i know its wrong.    To make matters worse she went a week ago to have dinner with her ex, who was down here for some time, because he was with his family and they still are in contact with her.    Here is the confusing part: She is very OPEN with everyone, and not only does she talk to her ex with those cute messages (you dont love me anymore?), she speaks to her ex-ex as well!  So what i thought could mean that she loves another man now just confused the living fuck out of me. Because she gives the same amount of attention to the 3rd guy as well, although he is another country.  She gets flirty text messages from other guys as well, but she shows me how she leaves them hanging just so i wont feel bad. Guys that live in slightly wealthier parts of town with 5 room houses and BMWs. Who are also ripped AND from venezuela. She tells me she doesn't believe in material things and loves people for who they are.   After our many fights she says she doesn't care about what other people say, that she is herself and thats how she carries herself through life.  I know my own self worth, im pretty ok good looking I believe, muscular, 6'0 72kg (170ish lbs) play rugby and i've had experience with women that are older... But wtf... I REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL.  And she told me ""i'm not going to predict the future, but i don't know about a relationship at this exact moment.""     She really does everything and a half for me... I don't know where to turn... She invited me on a business trip (sneaked me in of course) because the company payed for everything... Obviously thats not a dumb risk you take with anyone... She tells me ""im with you now and thats what matters"".  I'm really starting to like this girl, and she knows it, but i've never been too clingy, just overly jealous when we hang out during her text message barrage.    Should i end it? We already spoke about how no matter what happens romantically we will stay friends because we clicked with each other.  Should I just forget about her? The fact that we still do many things together just confuses me more  P.S sorry if it doesnt make much sense; i wrote it on an iphone.",r

n9it0,n9it0,YoureCoveredInBees,"TL;DR (Too long, debating on reading) at the bottom.  -------  I met this girl at the ending of my junior year in high school; my buddies and I brought out a boat to a lake behind our high school that we called 'The cliffs'. It wasn't much of a boat, but it was the epitome of that summer.   We were out on the boat one weekend when my buddy Tim all of a sudden shouts out ""Girls!"" and points to the shoreline, where three girls stood, watching us as we jumped out of the boat and tried to act macho while bringing the boat to the shore. I wasn't much of a social person, so I stayed on the boat and organized our stuff while my buddies went to talk to the girls. A few seconds later, I felt the boat drop down as I looked up to see one of the girls, brown hair and green eyes, climbing in. I introduced myself and we immediately connected; she played guitar like me, listened to the same music, went to the same school and the whole deal.  After hanging out for the day, I suggested that we make a campfire and I'll bring my guitar. She agreed, so I went home to grab my guitar and she apparently did the same. We made a campfire under the Texas stars and played our hearts out. That night I asked her out, with the persuasion of both her friends and mine. I probably should've kissed her that night, but I took it slow and hugged her goodbye when it started to get late.    The important stuff:  We dated for two months, and it was the best relationship I had. I was happy, she was my best friend and my confidante. Just before we hit our third month together, she left me for another guy. After being apart for another month, she broke up with the guy and came back to me. This created a pattern, of two to three awesome months together and one or two where she'd leave me for someone else. It kept going for a year, but then things tumbled downhill from there, and she finally left me for a guy she's been with for 7 months now- however, this guy treats her like shit. (which makes no sense)   I still think about her pretty often, and while it was a complicated relationship that we had, it was great when we got it right. I leave for Basic Training in january and I need some advice on whether or not I should let her know I'm still thinking of her or if I should just let it be.   If I do, what could I do to let her know? I was thinking about just writing a simple letter before I left but I would like to say goodbye.   Thanks in advance, Reddit.   **TL;DR** Met a girl, fell in love but she didn't return the feeling. She's with another guy that treats her like shit.

hq9gb,hq9gb,,"Ok so I have been dating this girl who goes to my college for a handful of weeks now.  I like how she does not play games, is very cute, likes a bunch of entertainment stuff I like on TV and movies etc.  The problem I have is that she is VERY reserved, and refuses to kiss me at all except for on the cheek.  I have been dating her for like 3+ weeks now where all the dates went well and not even a real kiss yet.  I am shocked honestly.  If she wasn't so nice I would have just gone to hook up with another girl because not even being able to kiss her is driving me crazy.  I'm used to sex by the third date if not sooner.  I am a very affectionate guy and her lack of physical affection is bothering me quite a bit.  How long should I put up with this before I move on?  I have told her how I am affectionate and want to kiss her, but she just keeps telling me patience is a virtue and ""wants to be sure"".  I don't want to end things because of this...but I am nearing the last straw if this lasts any longer.  What do you all think I should do?",r

c3sgn5s,pv11m,daric,"It sounds like a complicated situation.  I would guess that there are multiple, separate things going on at the same time.  (1) What feelings are you having, why do you think you are reacting in this way -- does it expose things you are insecure about in yourself or don't like about yourself?  In this case you should take a look to see what it touches on in you.  (2) What does this type of behavior mean about this girl, could it be some sort of warning sign?  In this case you should explore this more deeply to see what you might be getting yourself into, whether it's emotionally or just stuff like concerns about STD's.  (3) Are you feeling ambiguous boundaries?  You mention that she was ""forced"" to have sex but did not say no.  What do you make of this -- could it be that this is an indication that she is not trustworthy in some way?  I think it would be helpful to start to pick apart the different threads of feelings you are having.  Some of them might reveal useful information, some of them might just be your own shit that you need to deal with.  Some of it could be in the ""don't know yet"" box.",r
e7hj3s6,9muvdl,96Poppins,Is CTA the California Teachers Association? As a classified employee the person would be represented by the classified union.  Documentation is your friend. Find copies of the time cards. Most classified employees copy their time cards or sheets dated stamped to prove hours worked when problems arise.  Print out copies of all emails sent to administration regarding this. Districts will purge already sent emails to weaken employee documentations during labor disputes.  Set aside the perception of integrity bashing but document that it occurred by starting a word document og all interactions. Ask for a referral to a union attorney and ask you union representative to file a grievance on your behalf.  Do not meet with administration about the issue without your lawyer and union representative with you. Good luck 🍀.,l

DACA doesn't provide a pathway to citizenship. And because he entered without inspection, you can't do the normal Adjustment of Status process. The only potential option which avoids the 10 year ban is the advance parole, leave, reenter, and then apply for AoS.

My thoughts after looking into this are that in terms of fair use, it is a legal gray area, but is not enforced because 1) although Google profits from search results/user metadata/ads that result from indexing their photos, having their photos/site be indexed also benefits the company, and 2) owners of the photograph most likely have the option to opt out.

dttl4xw,7vhtoi,Daleth2,"&gt;Did you perform work with university funds? Did you do it on their property? Did you do it with their resources? etc.  Until we know what country the OP is in we can't speak to this. But if it were the US, none of those things would matter.   Here's what matters: (1) Was the OP a W2 employee of the university (OP, ""W2"" means an employee who gets regular paychecks with payroll and income taxes deducted from them). And if so, (2) was doing this project part of the OP's job?  If the answer to *both* those questions is yes, which I'm guessing it's probably not, then the project was likely work-for-hire (a.k.a. work made for hire) and the copyright is owned by the university. If the answer to either question is no, then *the only way* it could be work for hire is if BOTH of the following are true: (1) the university had the OP sign a work for hire agreement AND (2) the work OP did on this project was one of the nine types of works that the Copyright Act says can be the subject of a work for hire agreement (they're listed here: https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf). If it's not one of those nine types, then even the existence of a work-for-hire agreement wouldn't make it work for hire.  If it's not work for hire, then it belongs to the OP unless the OP signs an agreement assigning (transferring) it to the university--and I imagine she would've told us if she'd done that. So chances are, copyright in whatever part of this project is copyrightable belongs to the OP.  That means it's hers and the professor would be violating her copyright by copying it or by creating derivative works based on it.  OP, can you confirm that none of the things I've said above apply--not an employee, no work-for-hire agreement, etc? If you're in the US, I would recommend you immediately register your copyright in this work. It only costs like $55 and you can do it online.",l

What is the actual risk?  For the purposes of discussion, let's assume the website *does* in fact host some illegal content.  The vast majority of the time, an investigation will send a prosecutor after the content creator or distributor(s). It's often not worth the effort to track down individual viewers due to the fact that each viewer is an individual case and not really worth the distributed prosecutorial effort to collect evidence and try hundreds or thousands of cases in as many jurisdictions.  However, that is the vast majority of the time. What about the *one* time? The FBI might - right now - be building a big case and is looking forward to charging 1000's of users in order to bust a ""child porn ring"".  Even if 75% of the prosecutions end up being dismissed they get the headlines and will still accomplish their goal of shutting down the distributor: the website.  With the possibility of ending up on a sex crime list and the enormous social stigma that comes with those crimes, for me personally, almost any risk is too much.

1qxh31,1qxh31,carnage123,"Got out of a long relationship about a year ago (7 years of hell, long story) and I dated someone for about 3 months this past February. Didnt work out for several reasons, one being I have 2 kids and she didnt and we kinda where at different points in our lives. Anyways, when I normally talk to girls (online dating) Im usually a lot more relaxed, sarcastic, crude, flirty, and what have you because the fact is, I dont really care how it goes so I dont have anything to lose. Normally when I meet up with someone, it normally only lasts one meeting (I like to meet up at starbucks just to chat) and after that, we go our seperate ways because we dont mesh or whatever. So, one person emailed me first and its completely different. Im a little more uptight, not nearly as crude or sarcastic and a lot more reserved. I actually am a much more charming person when talking with her. We have met up twice now (which is rare) and things seem to be going really well and planing on meeting up this weekend (dont think Ive ever had 3 'dates' with someone on line, so this is actually kinda huge). These are my questions and concerns. I dont understand why Im not more relaxed and more joking. She brings out the soft gentle me. I also do not know how to be flirty with her as odd as it sounds. I can tell she has walls up, and I get that, but Im not sure we both feel comfortable with each other on that more intimate level and thats fine. Obviously she likes me to a certain degree because we do hangout and understand each other (we both have kids etc) but for once I am lost in how to progress the relationship. Normally I have the sexual tension to work off of and be flirty, but with her, I actually like her for her and am perfectly ok with going really slow. As of now, we just talk and enjoy each others company (which is great) but since this is literally the first time Ive taken it 'slow' I dont know how to act and figure out what she is thinking and feeling. Im a different person when Im with her than how Ive been with any other person and I dont know how to handle that lol.  also, Im 27, she is 29",r

c2s5sli,levyo,karmasutur3,"A lot (Read: Almost all) people change so much from 19 to 23 that it's almost never a good idea to start long term relationship at that time. To a lesser extent, the same is true for the 23-28 bracket, although not nearly as pronounced.   If you look at marriage statistics by age, it's a very predictable situation. Older people stay together much better than younger ones.   Another way to look at it is this:  IF you are thinking that things will get better, don't. In the future, you'll be fatter, more bored, with more responsibilities (Kids, mortgage, etc etc) and you'll have even more stress. If you are having problems handling the no stress of just being together now, what do you think is going to happen down the line when things get much harder?  Your relationship before you get married / have kids needs to be super solid, so that you have the basis to make it through difficult things.

We get along for the most part, we think the same way, believe the same things, people are shocked at how perfect we are for each other. I love him. We've lived together for around a year and a half now.     Here's my issue, though... he's been caught with porn. Now, I don't have any issue with porn whatsoever. But for this specific relationship, it's not healthy. He has a low sex drive already from working so hard, so it's highly unfair to waste what little he has on porn when I am so starved for sexual attention. This is mutually agreed upon.     However, he has had a problem with it in the past. I've caught him with various amounts of porn, from minor pictures to some seriously hurtful stuff (pictures of friends from 5+ yrs ago that he's purposefully holding onto, etc) The very last time I caught him, I told him that I would not put up with it any longer and he deleted everything and genuinely seemed to change to keep me.    Last night I came up behind him to hug him and just happened to glance at his phone where he was typing a piano piece in the url bar to search for it. One of the URLs that popped up was a link to pornhub. :( I confronted him about it and asked to see his phone history (something I rarely do without reasonable suspicion) and he refused. He put it where I couldn't get to it and made me beg for it for an hour. He said he was purposefully trying to piss me off. Not sure why, really.     So after begging and pleading for an hour he finally told me that he refuses to let me see it, told me that I was being crazy, but wouldn't say he had or hadn't been looking at porn. Wouldn't say why I couldn't see the history. I finally exploded and went to stay at a friends house.  While I was gone, he tried to convince me over text that Droid 2's ""Dont have history"" which is a load of bullshit, obviously. When I got home this morning, not only had he found his history, but he had wiped it clean. Confronted him and all of a sudden it was ""an accident, he pressed the wrong buttons.""  Whatever. Guys, I want to stay because I love him and he is, for the most part, a pretty good guy. But I'm so sick of the lies and him playing me for a fool. What do I need to do?

We are great together and have no problems, I see her almost every weekend.  She has an ex, Todd, that is a complete loser. Constantly drunk/high on god knows what, pills, etc. No job, no school, literally just walks around town high all day every day. Broke as a joke with no skills or education and nothing to live for except getting high. My girlfriend was almost killed by his actions a year ago.   I'm virtually the opposite of him and clean, and my girlfriend has told me time and time again she's done with bad boys and how its just a phase girls go through. She hadn't seen/heard from this loser in at least six months.  Fast forward to the other day, she tells me she's hanging out with him tonight, out of nowhere. And the next night. And the next night. Now, he's around virtually every day. She tells me he knows about me (and I'm sure he does) and that she constantly talks about me in front of him. She says she would never go back with him, and that her and him were no good together. And I believe her, I really do. She is genuine and has never lied to me, and I really do not think that she intends for him to be anything more than a friend again. She does not lie about him being around, she tells me everything and will text me when he's around and such.  But this guy. This guy is scum. I don't trust him one bit, and I feel the only reason he's around my girlfriend is to try and get back with her, or get some. He's a no good junkie and I know what he's trying to do. I've told her how I feel about him, but also, I am not controlling in any way and don't want to tell her who she can or can't hang out with.

fxme9,fxme9,blahhneedhelp,"I have been dating a woman for years through thick and thin. It was born and still exists under some form of long distance - whether an hour and a half away or hours away during a previous profession that I have since given up (but was unplanned to begin with) - and I think it is important that the one time I have been compelled to move in with her, I left her two months later, then got back together another two months afterward, and we have been living apart since (2 years ago).  All in all, we have broken up a handful of times in a four-year period, every single time me being the one who initiated it, and then me being the one who reopens lines of communication. It has been kind of hard figuring out if one of us is giving the other another chance, or if we are both giving each other another chance.  The biggest problems seem to stem from her anxiety. On a bright, sunny, happy day, everything can turn to absolute shit out of nowhere - usually a remark or a concern that stirs up some insatiable beast inside of her that will not stop until any positive emotions or feelings are completely blasted and impossible to rehash until about a week later. When this comes up while trying to draw an apology from her (I *always* have to draw apologies whether by fighting for them or by being so distant after being so slighted that it feels like drawing blood from a goddamn stone), there are two things she has always said for this entire time: ""I'm working on it"" and ""Sorry that I'm not perfect.""  I recently read a comment posted here recently saying basically saying good intentions are not a valid replacement for good results, and that is how I feel when I get pissed every time the words are ""I'm working on it"" instead of something more definitive and strong. Sometimes, I am able to see her through her anxiety, but most of the time it guides her to fight with me over some asinine bullshit, where the biggest problem is not something that just happened, but how we interact afterward. Case in point: two weeks ago I wanted to get off the phone after a good conversation we had just had, and was met with some serious resistance to getting off the phone after a ""happy, connecting moment,"" and we had a serious fight that just pissed me the hell off. After using up all of my patience, she said ""Give me some loving words,"" to which I had nothing to say whatsoever, and that made things even worse. The progression was essentially good to bad to really fucking bad, to the point where I did not even want to see her on her upcoming birthday (three days away from then).  As if I needed to make things worse, I am working toward a new path in the service for a number of positive reasons on my behalf (financial and family stability are not up there, but learning new skills and learning about military life are incredibly important for me). The process has been ongoing, and her discomfort with it gets overwhelming, but she refuses to leave. I broke things off over the summer because I did not feel like she was actively deciding to come with me or, despite her misgivings, tell me that she loved me so much after all we have been through that she would be honored to stay with me (or just wanted to stay with me, no honor necessary), and she was freaking out over every single facet of what life in the military leads to - long absences, the possibility of death, the possibility of missing the birth of our theoretical child. Not long afterward, we got back together somehow with no talk whatsoever of marriage and babies, but just because we loved each other so much and wanted to enjoy each other while we were still nearby. Fast forward a few months, she is talking about marriage and babies every other day, and I am just completely baffled because I had no idea we were that kind of ""back together."" Stupid of me, yes. So, I decided to bring it up realistically to see if she still had all the fears, and yup, they are still there.  Anyway, it has reached critical mass and I just dodged plans on going out to see her this weekend. Every time I sound cold and distant or whatever on the phone, she seems to need more from me, so she will ask things like ""Are you excited to see me this weekend?"" And I just don't have the energy anymore to be honest. I am just so worn out from putting myself through this.  Now, do I love her? I believe that I do. She has a great heart and means well, does a lot of great charity work and has a career in a field completely centered around helping others. She is beautiful, smart, hilarious, and we have a lot of similar interests (except for drinking, which I love doing but hardly ever do because when we see each other we stay indoors the whole time - she does not like bars or any crowded places and they tend to make her incredibly anxious and more volatile). She is also five years older than I am. I know that love is not the most important factor in a relationship - I have dumped and have been dumped when there was still plenty of love. Am I stupid? Probably.",r

d94o2qm,59027a,ComfirmRepeat,"You are free to tell the judge about all the incidents that occurred. Judge may berate you for not originally writing this down when you asked for the EPO but he will most likely still grant the EPO. Only way I can think of that he won't grant the EPO is if you have a history of making false reports to the police or something similar. If not you will get the EPO. This is because you don't need ""proof"" to get an EPO, only the belief that the other party intends to do you harm.  Your husband is full of shit. You signing the lease doesn't mean anything other than you live there.  Also you can add this to your arguement. You fear that your husband will retaliate against you if you do not get the EPO.  Also make sure to bring a copy of the recording and present it to the judge as evidence of abuse.  Also bring the text messages/make sure your phone is full battery  Also feel free to tell him how he tried to threatened you into not coming to court and about the fake text message.  Also after this is over, file a police report and send this asshole to jail.  Edit: if the court doesn't or police doesn't believed you, you can request them to subpoena those text message from the company and when they do, they won't be able to get the fake texts, only the real ones  Edit 2: also when you file out the police report, write down that your husband committed perjury in court and that they can prove it by subpoena your EPO court records when he talked about the fake text message and subpoena his phone company or facebook or whatever text messenger app he uses for the text messages. Usually goes a long way in court because now they can legally prove that he is a liar and argue that he is willing to lie in order to get out of trouble.",l

You should keep some limited time for her, but right now she's using you (not in some intentionally nefarious or malicious way) as an emotional surrogate for a boyfriend. This is preventing you from finding an equal (and equally interested partner). She's getting exactly what she wants and needs from a relationship with you - and it's not equitable enough to be healthy: you're looking for a lot more from her.      So, try dating. Go out without her. Set more clear boundaries. If she's really interested, she'll push harder for time with you. Otherwise, it'll make moving on a lot easier for you.",r

The local small towns chamber of commerce has land for sale for very cheap, but you need to provide proof of economical development. I wrote up a business case, submitted info to the chamber and patiently was waiting for a response.   Today I received a call from my companies CPO. He stated he had my purchase request in hand and was reading it. Mind you he works at the US headquarters 5 hours away. Long story short he asked me what my intentions were, asked if I had another job (I don’t just have ideas), and stated legal may call me.   Come to find out the plant manager at my plant is on the cities chamber of commerce. He saw my request as he needed to vote yes or no. He passed my request to local hr, who went to national hr, who passed it to the cpo. I am in a position where I can hire services...and my business could be used at the plant, but I had no intentions in doing so.   Now I feel somewhat violated that my personal business venture has been shared with people outside of those I approached.

7bh5ge,7bh5ge,throwaway01775,"Early in September, I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years, primarily because she was verbally/emotionally abusive.  We had a lease on the house that ran until mid-January. Since this happened, a notice to quit was put out (which she signed), and I've signed a new lease as the only tenant which goes into effect on November 15th.  I gave her $2350 to pack and ship her things to Hawaii. She came during one weekend with a friend to pack her things and return her key. Her house key is now in my possession, and the locks and garage code on the house have all been changed.  While she was here, she assembled a list of belongings she was unable to find. The total value of these belongings is probably less than $300.  We had two cats ""together"". One of them was in my possession before we started dating, the other we got while dating. They are both microchipped, and the information on their chips points to me. All their vet records are in my name, and I've spent thousands on their medical care over the last 2-3 years.  My ex is messaging me every day on Facebook now about restitution for her missing items. She also is referring to the cats as ""ours"", even though I'm pretty sure legally they're mine. She also wants custody of one of the cats. She found mold in a food bowl while she was here getting her things (there's an explanation for that, and I immediately bought a new bowl with an anti-microbial coating upon finding out), but I believe she's going to use a photo of that as evidence that I'm not properly taking care of them.  When it comes to the restitution, I gave her that $2350 and there's no record on what she spent it on. For all I know, she pocketed almost all the money, and now she's asking for more. I also don't understand how I could turn over one of the cats when all of that cat's records are in my name.  /r/legaladvice, what do I do?

4bsvpj,4bsvpj,MVAthrowaway,"TL;DR: Rear-ended while stopped on a highway.  Neck, back, and shoulders still hurt two weeks later. I'm having trouble finding adequate medical care. How do I decide if I need a lawyer and at what point in the process should I find one?  To be a little more specific, this was NOT in the southern part of the Commonwealth.  I was rear-ended on a highway when traffic in front of me came to a complete stop. I was stopped. The car behind me hit me at what seemed to be a low speed. There is no 3rd party report (police or EMS). The other driver has accepted fault.  My car has been fixed, paid for by the other driver's insurance.   I briefly spoke to the medical adjuster at the other person's insurance. It was not recorded. I said I had soft tissue injuries. The adjuster said ""Well, those can take a long time to heal or you might be feeling better already, right?"" I said, ""Maybe, but I'm still having issues and going back to the doctor today."" He then backed off and said he would call about every 3 weeks to check in. I was wary of talking to him at all, but this felt slimy. Most people will conversationally agree with you, whether they mean it or not. Even though I was watching for it, I still had a hard time disagreeing.  I was seen the day after the accident at urgent care. They took x-rays; I only have soft-tissue injuries. They gave me medication. Five days after the accident, I was still having pain and returned to the original urgent care place per advice. I was given a different medication and referred to physical therapy.  The physical therapy (PT) place does not treat spine injuries from MVA, so I was referred me to a chiropractor. My first appointment at the chiropractor place was pretty bad. I did not believe their priority was helping people feel better. I tried to get in to other PT places. Many do not take spine injuries from MVA. I have tried to get in an orthopedics place, but so far I have just been on hold until I hang up. I went to a second urgent care place associated with a local hospital about two weeks after the accident. They prescribed yet more different medications and exercises at home and told me to return in a week if I was not better.    I have missed some work due to appointments or recommendations from the doctor. I am required to be able to lift 30 pounds for my job. Currently, around 12 pounds is painful. It is possible to work around temporarily, but it was part of the job post when they hired me.   To make things a little more interesting, I am getting married and going on a honeymoon soon. These have been planned for months. I hope I feel better by then, but if I don't I'm still going to dance a bit at my own wedding. I worry the other insurance company will go ""Aha! You didn't sit at home miserable so clearly you are lying about the pain!"" I have not mentioned anything about this to the insurance company, but it might be hard to hide that I'm out of reach while I'm out of the country.   I'm kind of at a loss for what to do. I wasn't good with this kind of stuff before the accident. It's hard to navigate it all when I'm in pain and groggy from medication. I've been surprised at how many medical places have refused me.    I read the sidebar, the wiki, and some old posts about collisions. I didn't find what I was looking for. Can offer some tips about navigating this process? How do I know I need a lawyer? Is there a tipping point when it becomes worth it or easier to have a lawyer? Is there a downside to retaining counsel?  When in this process should I get a lawyer? Now? Some future time?",l

dtfpy,dtfpy,scaredgradthrowaway,"Hey everyone,  I've been with my girlfriend for over 2 years, roughly 1 of which was spent long distance (with 3 weeks long visits every other month though).  We've recently moved in together, but things have been deteriorating.  Arguments spark out of little things, she usually starts crying as soon as I make a single criticism towards her (she has no problem insulting/criticizing me before that though- at least I try to watch my language and make it respectful). We end up having long talks to figure things out, which makes it feel like we have moved forward but a few days/weeks later, it's the same cycle all over again.  It also doesn't help that I'm doing a PhD, and therefore have very little time to spend with her- we barely go out/do something together once a week. I'm aware that this probably contributes to it- but I have so much work that it's hard to overcome, and I don't think I'd drop something I've worked so hard for.  We've had relationship problems pretty much since the beginning, but the good always outweigh the bad, as we had really great times together. Now, not so much anymore.  As a result I'm more and more unsure that I really love her anymore. At times, it feels like I just go through the motions. I'm pretty sure she still loves me, which makes it harder.  As I said, we live together, so a breakup would be pretty terrible. We have one car for two, manage to live in a decent house with our combined income, but if I were to be alone my standards of life would greatly drop, which makes it even harder to make any hard decision.  Also, she's my first serious long term girlfriend, and I'm starting to feel that by staying with her, I might be missing out on other experiences (especially sexually), and that I should have dated more before settling with one person.

d9yrh9z,5cri5b,derspiny,"&gt; gave the requested $500 deposit cheque.  Unless this was applied to your first or last month's rent (and _only_ to those), this is an illegal deposit. You can apply to the Landlord Tenant Board for an order that the landlord return it. The landlord cannot evict you for receiving your deposit back.  &gt; They also informed us that they would be cashing the $500 deposit and this money would be returned to us plus interest at the end of our lease.   Oh, look, it wasn't. Off to the LTB with you. That's going to be your primary recourse for the maintenance issues, so you might as well file a single complaint that covers both.  Practically, the LTB can't compel your landlord to be nice to you, and generally won't order them to complete maintenance that doesn't affect the habitability of the unit. You'll probably want to start looking for a new place to live - an order terminating your lease before the end of the year (and returning your deposit money immediately) is probably a better solution in the long run, as much as moving sucks. If your landlord tries to pursue you for ""soaking the floor"" after you vacate, you can use most of the records you've gathered to defend yourself.",l

116hiw,116hiw,,"Well where do I begin? *sigh* ok in this story I'm going to seem like a heartless bitch or a horny slut but I'm being 100% honest. In February I broke up with my on-again/off-again ex(21/m who we will call Adam) and it was a bad messy break-up. Adam caught me kissing another Guy in his bedroom at Adam's house party and promptly kicked me out. We were living with each other at the time. It was through Adam that I met my current SO(19/m who will be called Billy). Adam's close friend always brought Billy over and so he was just an acquaintance to me for 3yrs. When me and Adam broke up I got lonely(ok, Horny) and sought attention from Billy. He's a sweet caring run of the mill GGG, he never made the 1st move and did say no to my advances. But in my defense, the way he said no was like a drunk girl! His mouth said no but he never fought back or even pushed my hands away, I would unzip his pants and well... play with him. He was hard and eventually after a couple 'dates' I decided to fuck him. He of course said 'no' but when I got on top of him he repositioned himself for better enjoyment, even so far as grabbing my hips to go faster. This went on for a couple of months before my ex Adam came back asking for me. I told Billy and I considered it. Billy by this time said he loved me and asked me to stay with him,  which I did and a month later I found out I was pregnant. But I was still in love with Adam and told him. Even begged him back. Billy knew all about this and supported me in whatever I wanted but ultimately wanted me to stay with him. When Adam got a new gf and cut me out of his life I finally got the hint... I stayed with Billy and through this all he still loved me. Never judged me and always eager to please. We were never official but we were having sex with solely each other. A fuck buddy if you will. But Billy wants a relationship, and although he's met my WHOLE family(who loves him to death) and wants to eventually get married AND be the father of my child. He's a bit over affectionate and in our relationship he's more the girl(emotionally) and I'm more the Douche. I respect Billy more than I love him and I love Adam more than I do Billy. I know Adams gone and I'm trying to move on with Billy but I'm not sure how to feel about this? Billy is my rebound sex but I'm not exactly satisfied. I've been honest to Billy and for the 1st time in my life I've been 100% faithful to someone. I do love Billy but just not as much as he loves me. I'm still not sure how I feel about this. He's still not my bf (I've been iffy about commitment with Billy) but he is my one and only. I sometimes feel trapped, like I'm expected to be with him because I'm pregnant. I don't want another relationship though. How do I proceed or how do I get over this feeling? I want to run from Billy everytime he gets serious .... I mean isn't he every girls dream Guy? Why can't I commit or idk. This is more of a rambling of a Confused girl. Please help? My mind and feelings are a complete mess",r

c2g4kjo,jyarq,talashira,"Three years, then. Wow.  Speaking to your summer plans... you must realize that three months out of a year do not a relationship make. But I'll let it go. Love is powerful enough to permit us to accept the possibility of pain, and besides, I can't say I haven't been there myself.  As for the jealousy issue... there is, first of all, nothing outrageous or out-of-the-ordinary about you being jealous of this. I would be too.  As for her, I don't think it's a sign that she consciously wants to move on, but she's always going to crave what she's missing from you -- what she knows she can no longer get from you. He's there; he's real; he's available. We are built to desire and seek physical closeness, and it often hurts to not have it.  If she feels she can quiet those cravings long enough to prepare for a real future with you without it doing any damage to her spirits, then that's wonderful. But again, it's usually too heavy a burden to bear. We as a social creature are not meant to handle this sort of thing. Oh, our brains can handle it, sure... but our instincts are much deeper seated and are almost always much, much louder.  If I had to play fortune-teller, I'd say that you're going to see this sort of thing pop up more and more often on both ends -- hers *and* yours. You may also just not hear about it; she knows it's not a wonderful thing for you to hear, so rather than vent to you and be honest about her feelings every time this type of incident occurs (and it will occur pretty often), she'll end up keeping them to herself, which is a slow but inevitable poison to the relationship.  I'm not trying to be a pessimist (I swear!), but I've seen it enough times to feel confident in handing that to you with a ""Guarantee"" sticker slapped on it.  Before I hit the ""Save"" button on this, I just want to urge you to take a good long look at this:  &gt; I think when/if it goes south, there will be no saving me for a long time.  That's not healthy -- not when neither of you are absolutely sure of your life together. That type of mindset should only exist in marriages.

26sjda,26sjda,ScribbleJ,"Just trying to get to the root of a conversation a coworker and I had this morning.  The ""Warrant Canary"" idea is that you post a message on a regular basis saying that you've never been served with a secret government request like in Apple's statement ""Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us."" Then when you are served, you remove that message, which is supposed to get around the requirement that you don't tell anyone that it has happened.  Most people who use these ""warrant canaries"" do it in a more stateful manner, updating them regularly with proof that they have in fact been updated (a recent headline, the date, GPG-signed, etc).  To me, this sounds ridiculous.  Of course you'd be forced to maintain the message even after it is a lie, in order to not reveal the secret order.  Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm curious if my intuition on this is correct.  Additionally, I'm wondering whether there's any actual example of this in known law, even if it's not directly related; an order to maintain some action in order to hide an order rather than to not take any action to expose it?

Evidence that your sister resided in NC at the time of birth (receipts of anything she paid for, utility bills, driver's license, bank/credit card statements/records, pay stubs, any type of local ongoing contract she may have had like a gym membership)  I think you just need to find everything you can and make your case as best you can and hopefully they will work with you even if you don't have the types of evidence they are hoping for.

I don't know how to react to it. She says she has always known she was attracted to girls as well as guys but last night was a defining moment for her and she feels like she properly understands what she feels for the first time. She says it doesn't change anything between us, and she seems to think that because it was a girl and not a guy its less of a big deal.  I of course have no issue with homosexuality or bisexuality, I just feel cheated/betrayed and I don't know what the best way to handle it is.  I don't want to break up with her.

A driver shouldn't be obliged to stop and check each pipe overhead, because the garage has told him that, regardless of how they look, the pipes are all above a certain height. A reasonable person would not second guess that posting unless it was so far below the clearance as to pose an obvious danger.  That question goes more to contributory negligence. The real question is if the garage is negligent. If the facts are as described, I think they are. They must ensure that their premises are fit for purpose, and if they post a clearance height, they are providing a representation as to how tall a vehicle can be without being damaged by pipes or signs, or the ceiling.  A sign, or the terms on the ticket stub wouldn't outweigh the representation made by the clearance sign. Since, the clearance is part of the contract.

This month, one roommate moved his computer over to his gf's apartment and hasn't been back. He paid rent (mostly) but he said he wasn't here and shouldn't have to pay electricity or internet, both paid as separate bills. He screwed us over on those bills without warning but I guess legally he has no obligation since the bills are in my name. That isn't a big deal because it's like $50 he skipped out on, I can take a small hit.  We're worried he's going to move out without warning and we're stuck paying his rent.

If he does not pay and we do not sign him off, what can we do? We cannot pay our apartment bill separately, they demand we pay the full value all at once. He has a key and if he takes all his stuff (which is almost no value) then moves out without warning, we don't even have his belongings to hold against him.

7woctz,7woctz,jinrocker,"About 3 months ago, I purchased a vehicle from my Maternal Grandmother. She had declining  physical and mental for over a year and had her drivers liscence revoked after a doctor's evaluation to she if she was safe to drive. Knowing that I needed a vehicle, she intended to gift it to me, but family issues prevented that. I agreed to purchase the vehicle instead for a price of $5000, which we both were aware was well under market value for the vehicle, but she refused to take anymore for it.  On November 17th, we completed the sale at a AAA location. I paid $300 in taxes (PA sales tax is 6%)  and an additional $97 in other fees. I was excited to have a good vehicle for once and thought that I was in the clear and everything was settled.  Until today.  Today I received a letter from the PA Bureau of Enforcement Planning Analysis and Discovery claiming that I owed an additional $487.50 in taxes on the vehicle. The Bureau asserts that I owe tax on their assessed price of the vehicle ($13,125.00) and not on the agreed purchase price. This was a complete shock to me, seeing as I could very easily asked to classify the transaction as a gift and given the state nothing.   After reviewing the documents I recieved, I also noted an error that may change the situation. The asset they listed and priced was a 2012 Ford Escape Limited 4 Door SUV with 4 wheel drive. While mostly correct, the vehicle does not have 4 wheel drive, only front wheel drive, as was reported at the time of sale and still holds true.   What are my options? Is there a way to not pay this tax amount or have it reduced? Am I able to dispute the price of the vehicle, or am I SOL? Any and all help is greatly appriciated. Thanks for reading.",l

11c0ro,11c0ro,,"I have been with a guy for around 9 months now. Were kinda chill as a couple. We dont really kiss or cuddle, or act romantic. Were more friends than anything but i do really love him and i think he loves me. We live together and its honestly the funnest relationship ive ever been in. Theres only a few problems. He has a bad superiority complex. Everyone is below him, even me. This wouldnt be such a problem if he didnt spend most of his school career doing hard drugs. He is so fucking stupid. About easy things. For an example. I tried to tell him what a Metaphor was once and he spent an hour telling me how i was the stupidest person he has ever met and how i was wrong untill i caved and sent him to google. He also has a kind of ""swinger"" attitude, which is fine and i knew about it when i started dating him. So he talks about all the girls he wants to fuck all the goddamn time but if a guy even comments on my facebook, he freaks out. Its starting to take a toll of my self confidence honestly. Also he wont open up to me. And i dont know if its because of me or not....all i know that there is this girl he fucked before we got together named Jamie. And when his best friend died a couple of months ago he wouldnt talk to me about it at all...but he spilled his soul to her in a fucking facebook message. Honestly? He would tell someone he dosnt even know about it but not his girlfriend that loves and actually gives a shit about the pain he is going through? I know the simplest answer is to break up with him. But i know the second i do hes just going to find someone else to fuck so im the only one thats going to be sad and lonely. Also, there are some good things that come from living with him. Im kind of a minimalist so i dont need a big place to live and everywhere here is to expensive for me to live by myself...and i live rent free bill free with him. Its honestly like 1) Be jealous and never feel like the person im with cares about me but be able to work on sewing that i could use to get out and live on for the rest of my life or 2) move out of arkansas, be really broke for a while and maybe in a year or two be able to start making stuff again...after the month or whatever of being sad because some other girl is sleeping in my spot.

You need to accept that this could fuck up royally and be prepared emotionally for it however maintain this great relationship until something, (and hopefully something doesn't) happens.  Another thing to keep in mind is her personality. Is she easily influenced by others? Is she relatively naive? Does she see and value a future with you? These are all factors in how she will interact with the males she meets and almost more importantly deal with the influences that her new friends will have on her.  I hope this all works out and best of luck :)",r

Hospital/healthcare won’t cover any treatment.**  Original Post:   &gt; Hello Reddit,  &gt;  &gt; About a year ago I was prescribed Atorvastin by my doctor, with the claim that it would help with my cholesterol. (Records of my cholesterol levels, however, indicate that my cholesterol was normal or at least nothing to be concerned for.) As a result of the prescribed medication, I have been diagnosed Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy; irreversible muscle damage, fatigue, and kidney damage just a few of the effects caused by this condition.  &gt;  &gt; Subsequently, I attended numerous infusions in order to treat my illness. The initial treatments were covered by the healthcare provided from my job. These health care benefits, however, expired with the new year. I hadn’t gone to work since I had been attending the infusion sessions— I had 5-7 hour sessions, 5 times a week. I was informed that my healthcare benefits had expired while checking in at the hospital and being told that I could not receive the treatment as I was no longer a member. Essentially, my benefits cancelled overnight; I even had the needle still in my arm, covered with a bandage from the infusion the day before. &gt;  &gt; The hospitable issued a claim that they are not responsible, due to arguments of the “standard of care.” Additionally, my healthcare benefits expired since I had not attended work— not only was I incapable of work, I was also off on medical leave. Therefore, in order to continue with treatments, I must pay over 100k out of pocket, each month. &gt;  &gt; This seems very unethical and is substantially misfortunate on my behalf. &gt;  &gt; Is there anything I could do in this case?     --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",l

I eventually had to decide that I couldn't get over the betrayal and the fact that he'd thrown it in my face.  I was not happy and realized that I couldn't live being miserable just to give my daughter the life I'd originally planned (with her 2 biological parents).  I realized that I'd be giving her more being a happy mother vs being a mother who struggled through every day and couldn't be a positive example of what a relationship should look like.

c2y3j3n,m34od,lawnessd,"Communication is everything.  Silence is not fucking golden in a relationship.  If she's actually flirting with them, then that's a problem.  Tell her you don't appreciate her flirting with other people in front of you.  Have you talked to her about being monogamous?  If you have, then you should talk to her and tell her that you have feelings of jealousy when you see her doing this.  Tell her you know she's not cheating on you, but it makes you feel as though she may.  Or, tell her that you don't feel very special when she flirts with other guys -- because that's something you feel you would like to remain within the relationship.  Explain that you don't flirt with other women, in front of her or when she's not around, and you don't appreciate that she's doing this.  If she's on the same page as you, and you openly communicate how you feel, then she'll understand, will be willing to talk to you, and will change this behavior.  However, don't tell her you expect her to change who she is.  Just tell her that you understand that the relationship is young, new, and fresh, and you two need to get used to it.  If it's going to be a serious relationship, you two need to come to an understanding, and YOU need to be able to communicate with HER.  But like I said, you can't change her.  However, certain behavior changes are generally typical when you enter a new relationship.  One of those is the way you act around other people (typically other genders, but all people in this case).  Explain that you quit flirting with girls because you're not single any more, you're happy with her, and you don't have any want or need to attract anyone else.  She should respect this and understand this.  Now, if it's not actually flirting, then it's not a big deal.  Just ask that she tone it down a little bit because it makes you feel jealous when it's done right in front of you.  This is understandable as well.  If you're just extremely, insanely, unreasonably, and irrationally jealous -- i.e., you get irate and quit talking to her every time she talks to another guy, then that's your issue.  You can't control her.  You shouldn't want to control her.  You're in a relationship with HER -- who she is -- her individual self who is roaming around this floating rock we call earth, just like you.  She can do what she wants whenever she wants and with whomever she wants.  You shouldn't want to change any of that.  It's up to you to determine that she matches what you want, and she needs to determine if you match what she wants.  If both of these are the case, then you'll want to be with her, trust her, and be in a relationship with her.  And, she'll want to be with you, won't cheat on you, will be honest with you, and will want to be be in a relationship with you -- which includes caring how you feel about the way she talks and acts around other guys.  But like I said, the key is to be honest and communicate.  And when you are mad, regardless of the reason, NEVER NEVER NEVER cut off communication.  I know you feel this is the way you can get the message across to her that you're mad, but this is unhealthy.  It's a bad habit to start and will only lead to disaster later in this relationship and in future relationships.  It's called passive-aggressive.  It's more common in women, and generally men use it because they believe it's the way women can understand it.  But all it does is add negativity to a relationship, and that is bad.  A relationship should be 2 individuals who agree to share their lives together.  They like each other as an individual and want to be a part of that.  They should only add positive things to each other's lives.  They should not take away positive things or add negative things.  It's just adding good, positive things to each other's lives.  This leaves no room for jealous, distrust, anger, or (especially) cutting off communication.  Communication and trust are everything.",r

Is she depressed, or religious or had a history of abuse?  4. Well, previous issues with this means probably only long term things, so I would say pill is out.    I have a story, which is a kind of word of warning: 99 per cent of women I've met have been normal human beings. (bear with me, slightly long)  Once upon a time, however, I met a girl, and it took me 4 years to realize what happened to me. I'm a relatively smart guy, I can infer from your paragraphs above that you are too, so it's worth a warning.   I got involved with a woman that was :   A. Without kindness or emotion, who was literally pure evil. A nasty little sociopath.  B. Probably the smartest (and most devious/smooth/clever) person I've ever met. Genius level IQ.  It forced me to redefine my definitions of what was possible as far as evil and manipulation were concerned. I mean, for example, she set up manipulations the first week we met that didn't come to effect until two years into the relationship. She was planning that far ahead. She knew what I was going to think and feel before I did, due to silent observation and undetectable hacking/snooping etc.   What I'm getting at is that she never actually wanted to be with me. She thought I had a future as a musician at the time. I found out later she kept 5-10 guys on the 'line' at all times, at different levels of 'lockdown' for different purposes. She didn't want me sexually. So through masterful manipulation, she was able to get me in a position where I believed that we were having a relationship, but in reality she wasn't remotely attracted to me. Dude, she was SO convincing. Like Frank Abignail. I was given the proof later: She was my 'long term girlfriend' cause I had a shot of blowing up as an artist, she was the 'other woman' to a couple lawyer/doctor types, trying to see if she could trap em into a suit for money I think, and she was screwing several guys without futures, who she found sexually attractive, and I mean SCREWING. Like orgy / public places / threesome screwing. But she spent no time with them. And she pulled all this off right under my nose, and I never would have found out if I hadn't stumbled upon the info through an incredible series of coincidences. (It involves a random drunk girl in a bar, a popular nude photo website, and then a lot of research on my part, including a questionable seizure of information ).   But it was like the matrix. I just knew something was wrong. It's a long story for another time, but what I'm getting at is this: If something is wrong, something is wrong. And this:  &gt;She feels that sex is time-consuming, that it demands energy, etc,  Dude, that's exactly how I always was left knowing how the manipulator felt. We had incredible sex, but it almost never happened. Well, she was like the world's best whore: I'm sure she never enjoyed a second of it.    I'm not saying your chick is that, but I am saying that she shouldn't feel like that, like it's a chore. That's way off. And you can't hide that shit. Whether you are hiding it because you're an evil demon (my ex) or just because you care for someone , or whatever, it comes out in the wash, so to speak.   It could be simple incompatibility.",r

c3xstqx,qckm7,hatscandal,"Darling, this is a paragraph:  All kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but a comparison, and a discovery of those relations, either constant or inconstant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This comparison we may make, either when both the objects are present to the senses, or when neither of them is present, or when only one. When both the objects are present to the senses along with the relation, we call this perception rather than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or any action, properly speaking, but a mere passive admission of the impressions thro' the organs of sensation.' According to this way of thinking, we ought not to receive as reasoning any of the observations we may make concerning identity, and the relations of time and .place; since in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations of objects. 'Tis only causation, which produces such a connexion, as to give us assurance from the existence or action of one object, that 'twas follow'd or preceded by any other existence or action; nor can the other two relations be ever made use of in reasoning, except so far as they either affect or are affected by it. There is nothing in any objects to perswade us, that they are either always remote or always contiguous; and when from experience and observation we discover, that their relation in this particular is invariable, we, always conclude there is some secret cause, which separates or unites them. The same reasoning extends to identity. We readily suppose an object may continue individually the same, tho' several times absent from and present to the senses; and ascribe to it an identity, notwithstanding the interruption of the perception, whenever we conclude, that if we had kept our eye or hand constantly upon it, it wou'd have convey'd an invariable and uninterrupted perception. But this conclusion beyond the impressions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of cause and effect; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the object is not chang'd upon us, however much the new object may resemble that which was formerly present to the senses."" Whenever we discover such a perfect resemblance, we consider, whether it be common in that species of objects; whether possibly or probably any cause cou'd operate in producing the change and resemblance; and according as we determine concerning these causes and effects, we form our judgment concerning the identity of the object.

pl3cq,pl3cq,,"(Editing in key information at the top: I'm male, 25; she's a female, 27; together six years; living together for eighteen months.)  We've been together for about six years, and living together for eighteen months. Almost immediately after we moved in together, she went through a ton of family issues (alcoholic father and some other stuff). For the next year, it consumed her life, and mine, too. She developed extreme depression, extreme anxiety, extreme apathy, and all intimacy between us halted completely. I was working an extremely stressful job and the only way I could deal with my own situation and hers was to slowly distance myself from her. I was endlessly patient and would listen to her problems and respond, but I just stopped caring. I couldn't let them affect me any longer. I urged her constantly to try to detach herself from her situation (it was really beyond her control), but she remained obsessed for a full year.  Although some of the effects are still lingering, today, her personal life is *much* better -- she's made great strides -- but the distance between us remains. Well, it remains for me. She wants to be together forever, but I feel like the damage has been done. I do not feel invested in the relationship at all any longer, emotionally or physically, and I can't force myself to be. I love her, but I don't want to be with her any longer.  There are some other issues, too. Her pet ferrets use the house as their personal toilet, which is filthy. Our big house is filled with boxes and boxes and boxes of shit she ""was forced to"" acquire from her parents when they split up. If I mention either, she just gets angry.  I know I can't keep going like this, and I'm going to have to break up with her, and it's going to absolutely destroy her. Is there anything I can do to soften the blow? We're going to have to remain living together for at least a couple months afterward...any way to make that less miserable?  Finally...am I a horrible person for not being able to rekindle what we once had? I can't help but constantly feeling like absolute shit over this.  **tl;dr:** six-year relationship with eighteen-month live-in girlfriend is slowly dying...any way to soften the breakup or ease the post-breakup living together?",r
cqzzbqp,3511y7,Fury_LMD,"There are some weird things going on with this article.  First, there is no ""U.S. District Court of Omaha.""  There's a District of Nebraska with an Omaha division.  The article here just copies the phrase ""U.S. District Court of Omaha"" from the plaintiff's complaint -- without ever checking to see if that's correct.  Second, the article classifies the complaint as a ""letter,"" but it's definitely in the style of a complaint -- with enumerated paragraphs outlining the basis of the plaintiff's (certainly deluded) cause of action.  It's also captioned pretty much correctly and signed by the (insane) pro se plaintiff.  Other than being handwritten, it doesn't look anything like a letter.  The court obviously assigned it an office number and a case number and treated it as a complaint.  To call it a ""letter"" is bad journalism (even though it gets the spirit of the whole thing correct: this complaint is demented and sad -- but it's still a complaint).  (btw, for anybody who'd like to look it up, you'll find it as Entry No. 1 on the docket for _Driskell v. Homosexuals_, US-DIS-NED 8:15cv158)  That being said, if I were judge, I probably wouldn't dismiss the case at all -- NOT because I think it's valid but because the court (in most circumstances) can't dismiss a complaint on its own initiative.  I don't mean to say a court could never do that -- just that usually a court would wait for an answer to the complaint before doing anything.  That answer, of course, will never come.  So at that point, the case will either languish OR the plaintiff will file for default judgment (since the ""defendant"" never answered).  At that point, the defects in standing, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, inadequate notice, no service, etc. would all stand in the way of a court granting a default judgment.  But, surprisingly, ""dismissal"" (as a procedural thing under FRCP 12) might never enter into it.",l
1ff3wg,1ff3wg,lasmegan,"I'm 26, have been in a relationship for one year with my 31-year-old boyfriend, no kids, no addictions, grew up in a house with an alcoholic father. There's also pervasive alcoholism throughout my family. I'll drink socially maybe once every two or three weeks.My boyfriend is so incredibly kind, caring, patient, and giving when he is sober. Unfortunately, he has a drinking problem. There are peaks and valleys in his drinking and he doesn't think he has a problem.Lately, it's become worse. Last night, he stayed out all night -- a first in our relationship. When I texted him early this morning, he said that he was sorry, hadn't meant to stay out so late, and would be back soon. He still wasn't back an hour and a half later when I was leaving for work.It seems like he understands my concerns when we argue about the topic, but he goes back to his old ways a few days to a week after I relax. He'll tell me it's my fault that he gets so drunk when we're fighting about it and he's intoxicated. When he's sober, he's incredibly placating.I understand alcoholism and I don't want to bring children into a house like the one of my childhood.

But if she comes to you all cute, and says happily with a smile, ""Uh oh, who is this on your phone?

8f5w8p,8f5w8p,vonscorpio,"Washington State.   I was here roughly [6 months ago asking what is normal for turn around time on a personal injury case related to a car accident in 2016.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/78zhv8/working_with_personal_injury_attorney_what_is/)   I was informed cases like these can take years, which I accept. Treatment was considered as complete as it was going to get at that point.   Unfortunately for me, in December of 2017 I was again involved in a rear-end collision, potentially complicating the situation. I was again injured.   My attorney for the 2016 case is aware of the situation, and has sent me the paperwork for me to engage their services for the 2017 event. Otherwise I only hear from their office if I reach out. They have told me they have all my medical paperwork and would put together a letter soon - that was in January I believe.   My question is: should I wait to see some kind of progress on their end (i.e. the “demand” letter) for the 2016 case before handing them another one?   ~~Also, should I discuss a frequent shopper punch card? After 5 cases, the 6th one is free?~~ I meant that last part as a joke...    *Edit: Thanks for the advice!",l

dupv6,dupv6,Xylax,"Hello /r/relationshipadvice/,  I dated this girl a few months back, and she went on an extended vacation with her family for about a month, 5 days after I asked her out. We were limited to text messaging because she won't talk on the phone, to anybody. We had some deep conversations (I know, it's largely impossible to have deep conversations through text message, but I was thinking about it hard), and we had no secrets.  A couple weeks after she got she started avoiding me and being mean to me. She told me she wouldn't hang out with me until she had watched all 5 seasons of a TV show. This really upset me and I told her that, but she insisted. After that, we had plans to go to the fair together, but of course, she told me ""Don't know if I can make it, don't make it a plan"". That statement was where my sister suspected something was up.  August 25. I told her she had been very mean to me lately and to please stop. She said ""you're right, i'm being a bitch and you deserve better. that's why i think we should breakup. i'm not ready for a relationship""  We broke up. I told her I'd wait as long as necessary for her to be ready. She didn't object to this, so I assume she *might* be interested in a future relationship.  We still talked every day, just as we did when we were dating. About a month after we broke up, she told me randomly ""I was thinking back at how I've treated you at times and I wanted to say I'm sorry. it will never EVER happen again. you really didn't deserve that. the stupid part of me is gone now and it's not coming back. my stupid phase is over""  When she said that, I thought that she was telling me that she believed she was ready for a relationship. I didn't ask if that's what she was trying to tell me indirectly.  On Halloween, I'm planning on asking her if she thought about getting back together, and if so, if she wants to. I really really like this girl and she's a lot of fun to be around.   Do you think she hinted that she's ready? Or did she just apologize.  Thanks /r/relationshipadvice/",r

A boyfriend of mine was getting all massaged up by a very flirty girl who kind of had a thing for him, right in front of me!! They were both facing me!! She knew we were going out. My then bf first half-ass resisted it, but went into submission. Fucking cunt did that to get a rise out of me, but I didn't do anything. It's not my job to say, ""hey, back off. That's my boyfriend.""   It was his job to firmly decline and stand by that. I definitely lost face that day, and he should've at least patch it back up for me.   Moral of the story: respect your girlfriend if she feels that what you are doing is offending her. Some girls are mean, and maybe your friend isn't innocently ""flirting"" back with you. Your friend should respect your girlfriend as well. And.. It's really not about insecurity, but different values.  Too bad we all can't meet eye to eye.     ;)",r

c12koqi,dn2v1,,"I would think with your mind rather than your wallet. Spending $40-50 dollars on material things, just for the sake of spending that much, is overdoing it. Unless you're a fucking high-roller, spending that much after 2 weeks of dating shows a lack of confidence and borders on clinginess--it comes off as trying to ""secure"" her relationship interest like an investor would with a stock or bond.  My advice is to do something utterly creative. It could cost nothing (write a poem or song), a few dollars out of your pocket (make her a special dinner), or the full $40-50 you described earlier (tickets to a concert or play, but really you're halving that by buying yourself a ticket as well).",r

mhv5u,mhv5u,,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this. My mother has just broken up with her boyfriend of 4 years. She's recently started going through menopause and at the moment she's extremely emotional, to say the least. She spends a fortune on homeopathic medicine, which I've told her is doing nothing at all for her. My father cheated on her with her best friend about 14 years ago, and so growing up without a father figure has been difficult for me. She's had a few boyfriends since then, and each time they've reached an end, It's emotionally crippled me too... It's been the end of a relationship for me, each time. I live with her and I'm subject to it all. It's happened so many times that I'm kind of numb to it now, but it's still really difficult to be caught in the middle.  At 24, I've actually never been in a relationship, and yet somehow I'm finding I have to give relationship advice to my mother. I'm not very good at this. I'm also expected to talk to her boyfriend now and to be a conduit between them, as they aren't on speaking terms. (She will basically interrogate me for information if she finds out I've been speaking to him)... I feel this is completely unreasonable as it makes me so uncomfortable, but when I try to get this across to her she will say how important my loyalty is to her, and she'll remind me how much she's done for me over the years.  It's not too much to ask me to be there for her, even though I'm not very good at it... I'm doing my best to console her, but I draw the line at being used as this mediator, it's all making me quite upset. I'm going through severe depression myself, and like I said I've NEVER had any romantic intimacy of any sort, so it's all a bit much to get involved in the destruction of another one of her relationships.  As for why they broke up, it seems to be a fairly typical reason - she needed commitment in the form of marriage or just to be recognised and prioritised in his life, but he's a fairly independent kind of guy and he doesn't seem to want to compromise his lifestyle. She has abandonment issues because of the way her marriage broke up, and he has commitment issues because apparently his previous marriage robbed him of independence.  All in all, they've reached a point where they can't talk about it to each other anymore, so they are relying on me to 'fix' it for them, or at least to clarify each other's position so they can better understand it. They don't realise how insensitive it is to expect this of me... Whenever I speak openly about how this is affecting ME, I'm guilted into just accepting it. I spend a lot of time in these one way conversations, just nodding and drifting off, totally uninterested and extremely frustrated, as I'm very time poor. The advice I offer is usually too cold and logical to be accepted, so for the most part I'm just being used to talk at and to relay information from one person to the other. They don't realise how much I'm hurting right now, and that just makes it hurt more. What do?",r

It wasn't like she was paying my rent, or helping me get off the needle, or anything like that. But she still gave me some support by getting the word out and whatnot.

18kiha,18kiha,Throwinuprainbows,"First post...scary. So why im on this ledge of the reddital abyss I mieswell jump. I Got out of a relationship a bout a year ago. The problem is that i have a Special Nervous system condition and sometimes go into a waking coma with no real thoughts other than, fear(fight or flght response), and what going on this second, no reasoning...or well very wrong and obscure reasoning i should say. I was Quite short temperd and with a GF in major need of love and self esteem. I however couldnt see past me so I would yell at her for simple things naggin me to clean my mess to many times in a short time period, not wanting me to always be with a group of friends except for sex and sleeping.  calling her bitch, cunt etc.   so i wake up from debacle and find a very diffrent relastionship this and i have Little idea whys shes so hurt, why her self esteem has tanked. she she tells me IM sorry your too sick, Its become to much to take, i just cant take care of you over myself. I only thinking its my sickness, my fualt, that i horrible, worthless, and i just silently say goodbye and watch her go. she than txts me every guy shes seeing and how mad and hurt she was when she broke up with me so that she has to get out her aggression...thats its partly my fault. and shes right in a way. It is.      What can I do, im sick,I have no right to make another in pain as they watch me suffer or act like the evil zombie me in between attacks. All i do is take half the time, i cant have sex when ever they wants it or they way they want it all the time( my last gf liked it really rough, chking, knives all that jazz) . i Cant always take a girl places or afford to when i can. im not worth it. My friends say im attractive as hell,(used to be a national team gymnast so even through sick kept an working body. if i couldnt flip anymore id be one hell of a sad panda), funny,wise, smart, kind. Dont Quite beLIEve it all but what ever because i cant talk to girls now anywho. I mean what do i have to give them? fleeting moments of happiness followed by sadness, worry, and eventually loathing due to attacks and arguments while im in a coma state. how can someone forgive you than? its you making doing it, though your not really your self.more like an animal. lol mind fuck. in the ends its still you, so what they see a huge difference between the two now,any future GF wont know before it happens.  In all honesty m afraid of getting hurt as much as hurting, so yeah normal right? I'm like everyone...except... #FML.

1x7fai,1x7fai,Kanyeisagayfish,"Throwaway because privacy.    My girlfriend just got back from vacation out of state. Beforehand, she told me she was going to meet up with her lesbian friend (who I knew had a crush on my girlfriend), and her girlfriend. I didn't think I had anything to worry about, because I trusted her without a doubt.    Long story short, she largely ignored me for most of her trip. The day after she got back, she told me she stayed with just her lesbian friend for the trip, and that her friend kissed her on the cheek once. Further questioning revealed that it happened more than once, that she kissed her friend back, and that they also made out one time. She says nothing else happened, but I'm not sure if I believe her since she had just lied to me.    Now I've never defined exactly what cheating is to myself, but since my girlfriend participated instead of ending it, I do feel cheated. She also says she now feels attached to this girl.    I found this out last night, so I'm still processing it. I feel hurt and betrayed. I love this girl, but we've been together for less than a year (almost 11 months).

Then a few days later Dani and I had sex again (I used a condom both times I always wrap up). The day following that I had sex with Amanda who was my ex at the time. Now she's very angry with me and doesn't believe I am telling the truth about it and thinks more happened. A little background about Amanda and I... We dated for about 3 months then she broke up with me. We were still acting like we were together for the 2 months following we officially got back together. A month later she dumped me again. She wanted nothing to do with me then 1/2 a month goes by and we start talking again. About a month after we started talking I had sex with Dani and started having sex with Amanda a week before that (or that's what Amanda told me kinda fuzzy on that part).

1erm2g,1erm2g,doubledip10,"Background: Last summer me, a 24 year old male professional, started a lovely relationship with a lovely 22 year old female student.  The summer was amazing we had great communication did everything together talked about our futures etc.  Then she went back to school, 2 hours away.  It wasn't a big deal we would see each other every weekend, and talk or webchat every night. Trust was never an issue.  Later that fall I took her virginity and we were closer than ever.  We had both been with a lot of people previously, I had been in a serious relationship and had a lot of women under my belt, and she has experimented with half the state, but she had never had a serious relationship.  After a fruitful fall of meeting all of her family, and a very expensive Christmas for me, where I skipped going home and stayed with her family. She finally came up and met some of my extended family.  About 2 weeks later she said she felt ""medium"" about me.  So we took a 2 day break, eventually we got back together her saying that she missed me and was willing to work to try and make the relationship work. So then I spent a shit ton of money on her for her birthday and valentines day, where we had a lovely vacation together and she said the spark was back.  A month later we went on a vacation with her friends and yet again her hesitations crept back up. She said she felt a lot of pressure from me about my long term plans and she felt she couldn't meet my expectations and didn't want to be painted into a corner.  I tried my best to reassure her that my expectations were nothing more than just hopes and dreams, but to no avail. Yet again we were on another break.  The day before my mother flies out to meet her she decides to break up with me, saying that she is under too much pressure and too stressed.  Which is incredibly frustrating because compared to my level of ""stress"" her obligations are child's play.  So for the last 2 months we have been broken up, talking on and off and sending each other funny links.  She also told me she made out with a guy one weekend while we were apart.    Once she came back after school got out, we have hooked up a few times, and sometimes she comes over and we will cuddle and do couple activities.  She emphasized that she doesn't want to get back together right away, she just wants to lay low and let things play out and see how the summer goes.    Situation: What do I do?  I am on the fence on whether or not I should be open to getting back together with her, and if I do want her back how should I play it?  I have been doing a pretty good job of going with the flow, and playing it cool, but I'm a planner and the uncertainty is driving me fucking insane.   I still like her a lot, and feel we have a decent shot at a future together, however I'm not a fan of how I've been treated and am actually pretty pissed about it.  Half of me wants me to tell her to fuck off, the other half wants us to get back together and continue where we left off.  I'm aware the correct response would be for me to not care and follow her lead, and see if there are any other girls that are available. I have been driving myself nuts doing that, its not a long term sustainable solution for my mental capacity.",r

Ultimately, you're safest selecting ""Yes"", and explaining it in the comments. USCIS does not mess around, and fraud or willful misrepresentation on an application can lead to a permenant bar on all visas or citizenship processing. But a Yes in section 11 isn't an automatic disqualifier, and there's no way being stopped at a roadside check without even an arrest would hold up an application.

dcbobei,5nf8f4,improperlycited,"Your first link is discussing the tax status of reimbursement (but wages and so not taxable), not a requirement for employers to reimburse employees.  Your second link is much better, but would cell phones be considered a ""tool of the trade""?  I think 20 years ago they probably would, but it seems unlikely now.  OP doesn't need a smart phone or data, just any cell phone.  I literally do not know a person who doesn't own one.  92% of American adults have one (2/3 have smart phones) and that is skewed heavily toward the younger population (older generations much less likely to have it.). So can sometimes that well over 90 of the workforce owns and uses for personally and business use be considered a ""tool of the trade""?  If the company said ""you need to buy this particular cell phone"" then sure.  Maybe even if they required some special feature, depending on the prevalence (Bluetooth? Probably wouldn't count since like 99.8% of phones have it.  Apple's new wireless standard for their headphones?  More likely since such a small minority of phones have it.). But just ""a cell phone"" seems very unlikely in my mind to be considered a tool of the trade.   My only other quibble is with your $.14/hour number, which assumes OP is working full time.  If he's working fewer hours, it'll be much easier to reach that $.85 difference in minimum wages.

6u4nzf,6u4nzf,flickin_the_bean,"Details: Employed for over a year. Medium sized (50ish employees) company in Oregon. He has two positions, one in production and assembly and he just completed training for another position having to do with shipping. For privacy I will say that his position has him working in a carpentry/warehouse (no large machinery, no forklift) capacity and then the new part time position is computer based.   Health: he has a history of weird sleep issues including daytime drowsiness. If he is sitting or even standing and not doing anything his eyes will get heavy. He sleep walks and often wakes up exhausted. He recently had a sleep study to try and address this issue. He took a day off work, using PTO, to complete this. He doesn't hide these things  from his employer and it doesn't affect his work. He drives with no problem, never any injuries on the job, he just can't be sitting still doing nothing without getting droopy eyelids for a few seconds here and there.   HR is telling him that they would like a doctors note saying that he is okay to work. Another supervisor is telling him that they have to have this otherwise his job may be at risk. He doesn't have distinct diagnosis and the process of addressing the sleep issue has been ongoing for probably 6 months. The doctor that he saw is being very difficult to get a hold of and has not provided the letter despite my bf calling every day and the office ensuring it will be done every day.   He feels like this sleep issue has not affected his work performance, attendance or safety and he has not requested any special accommodations. I guess this supervisor recently saw my bf looking very tired and drowsy at work one day. His 10 hour shift starts at 6am and there are often mandatory overtime days. So he works a lot. His supervisor is justifying needing this doctors note by saying it is unsafe to have someone working who ""uncontrollably falls asleep"". This is not the reality at all. He will be drowsy in the morning when they are doing morning stretches or if he is just sitting but absolutely never when he is actually working or doing things and he is never actually asleep.   Can they legally ask for this type of medical information and can they imply termination if he does not provide it?   Another thing that we are beginning to think may be a factor is that he is in recovery from opiate addiction and he is somewhat open about that at work. He has been clean for about 2.5 years. HR knows about this as well as the supervisor who has been threatening his job. They drug tested him upon hire and then again a year ago after he left work early due to an emergency at home. He is drug tested semi frequently by his doctor or through the recovery house that he manages and always passes. I feel like maybe they suspect he is not clean and instead of addressing the issue they are going this roundabout way to make him prove he is.   I just don't see how they can say that a potential medical problem that he has had his entire life is suddenly a problem now that he is investigating what could be going on. They cannot point to any particular time and say that it caused problems with safety or productivity, it's just that they feel like he is at times visibly more drowsy than someone 'should' be. How is that a reasonable ground for requesting medical information?   From a completely objective standpoint, yes it is bizarre that he gets this drowsy. He has been like this our entire relationship and his entire life. It appears weird but it doesn't significantly affect his life except when I get irritated that he rarely sleeps through the night without doing some weird stuff that wakes me up.   Thank you for reading, if there are other details I left out please ask and I will add the details.  Edit to add tldr: boyfriends work is requesting doctors notes clearing him to work even though he has had this issue his whole life and worked at this place for almost two years. He does not feel it has negatively affected work productivity, safety or attendance.",l

meqqq,meqqq,,"So this attractive Japanese foreign exchange student has been giving me what could either be interpreted as signals or friendly gestures for the past few months. I finally decide to go for it, and I tell her that I'm attracted to her at a party. We're both drunk at this point. The interaction goes like this  Her: 'Really?'  Me: 'yes, but I really don't want to make you feel uncomfortable, so if you don't feel the same way I am fine with just being really good friends'.  Her: 'Is there anyone else?'  Me: 'yeah, a couple of people'  She then goes silent, I ask her if she's attracted to anyone in the house, and she says 'I haven't decided yet'. I get her to sit on a couch with me, and a couple minutes later she's leaning on the shoulder of some naked dude while drunkenly grasping at my arm. I then leave because I assumed that I read the signs wrong and she isn't attracted to me.  What complicates this point is that the next day she sends me a facebook message apologizing for 'offending me last night'. I tell her I don't know what she's apologizing for, but not to worry about it, and she says 'have a good day', end of conversation. But ever since that interaction, she hasn't talked to me, and seems to be intentionally ignoring me. I catch her looking at me sometimes, but that's it.  This (what I interpret as) semi-flirtation, where there's no communication but there are signs, happens to me fairly frequently, and I really really hate it. I don't know how to deal with these situations. From what you've read, do you guys think that this person attracted to me, or did I just make her deeply uncomfortable? And how should I deal with this new awkwardness in our relationship? I can provide more details in the comments section if you need more info.",r

rvvqu,rvvqu,,"Hey [/r/relationshipadvice](/r/relationshipadvice). So my girlfriend and I have been together a little over a year, we're 21 and 22, in our last couple years of college, and planning on staying together post-college, maybe moving in together, etc.   When I first met her sister, before my gf and I were really together, she and I didn't get along so much. Not terrible, but we didn't know each other. As we've gotten to know each other more, we've become better friends, and actually have a lot in common, which is nice.  She and her boyfriend and my girlfriend and I do a lot of stuff together when we hang out. The sister lives a couple hours away, closer to my girlfriend's parents, so when we're visiting the parents, we hang out with the sister and sister's boyfriend. They're a little older, 26 &amp; 27 and have been together for a couple years.  Anyway, the gf's family takes a family trip every year, and they were nice enough to bring me along. Her parents, her, me, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend. A really fun trip. We're all still getting along really well and everything.  A couple days after the trip ended, I'm back home in our college town, the gf is still at home. I get a call from my girlfriend after some cryptic questions all day. And apparently, the sister is really upset with me, for a reason that's not apparent. She claims I fought with her and the boyfriend during the trip (which I didn't do, I'm always really good around the family, and any argument my girlfriend and I have we save for when we're alone — no bad vibes).   I guess she's been saying a LOT of stuff. My girlfriend won't tell me everything because it's apparently really harsh, harsh stuff. She said she's been ""killing herself"" over it the last couple of days. (Mind you, it's been two weeks since all of this went down). What I did hear was the alleged fighting, as well as a time she called when the family was all together (me included), she was put on speaker, and apparently I'm not allowed to talk. There was a third time when we were at dinner on the trip, and she wanted everyone to get ribs (a hallmark of the place), and I joked with her and told her I was going to get a steak. Big deal, right? Apparently it was. She was upset that I jokingly suggested that I wouldn't follow her directions about my meal.  My girlfriend's talked to her parents, her sister's boyfriend, and all of her friends to try to get some perspective on something, e.g.: maybe she's just not noticing me fighting with everyone or something?  But they all had the same reaction: eltycreative? No, he's always so nice around us, I bet she's just making this stuff up. Which the sister has some history of doing.   But my girlfriend and her sister are really close. My girlfriend has my back on this, 100%, and even mentioned that this is just making us closer together. But she's also said that the sister is ""showing her true colors"" and (it appears to me) is suddenly and inexplicably disproving of me as a worthy suitor for her little sister (my gf).  **Here's the reason I'm posting now: We're going to the parents house for the weekend and I'll be seeing the sister for the first time since all of this went down. And I'm not quite sure how to respond when I see her. Continue reading, questions at end.**  Now, just a couple days ago, she facebook messaged my girlfriend, pseudo-apologizing:  ""I am sorry for how everything happened... I never meant to upset you so much. I heard **both of you are both coming for the weekend** and I wont be mean to either of you.""  Good, and everything. But it's not really an apology. All she's saying is that she's sorry for saying anything, and that she won't be mean to us.  Buuuut: She still has a problem with me. There's something that says she doesn't like who I am and doesn't approve of me. I don't understand, we were really good together before all this. So a couple questions maybe you guys can help me think out are:  • Did I actually do something to upset her, and if so, how can I avoid making that mistake again? Or is she just being crazy  • How do I react when I see her this weekend? I'm thinking just kill her with kindness, and put the ball in her court. But I just feel dejected, and I'm not sure why I'm being rejected.   • While the family whole-heartedly disbelieves what happened, the sister does carry a lot of weight in decision making; she's very stubborn and refuses to do something unless her conditions are met. (Honestly, I don't really care, I admire her for sticking to her guns and I'm usually not one who has to meet her conditions, save for the ribs incident). So how do I make this right? How do I prove that I'm not some conniving jackass?  So there it is. **TL;DR girlfriend's sister suddenly hates me for no reason, issues empty apology, not sure how to react when I see her this weekend for the first time since.**  Thanks!",r

It was going on so well that, she even gave up sleeping pills because of me. I was so happy to have helped her get back on her feet once again. I could see that she was a happier person and was back to her old self once again.   As days passed by, we started out hanging out together. Nothing intimate, but just two friends having some fun. But last night things got a bit weird. In the course of the movie last night, we started holding hands and getting all intimate. We roamed the city for the entire fucking night on my motorbike and she was necking me throughout sitting as my pillion. My self-control went kaput and I didn't resist her advances. I dropped her back at her place and was all 'What the fuck just happened'   From what I gathered from all the text and IM messages and phone calls in the last 36 hours, I think she is falling in love with me. She said, she is confused about our relationship and started telling me that I was too nice a person (... now a pat on the back)   However, there is no future in this relationship and both of us agree to that. She got a bit hurt when I said, the only way not to make this guilt trip worse is to stop hanging out as we once did. She is really hurt now and I am feeling bad for it.

So, there's obviously a much, much longer story here, but the short version is that my Dad immigrated to the US a very long time ago and raised us kids here in the US. We're all adults now and upon retiring, he decided to spend some time back in his home country. After about 6 months, something cracked, and he declared that he was cutting himself off from everyone here in the US. The nitty gritty details have all passed, the official divorce from my mom and financial settlings etc. I think the burden was mostly financial in the same way that poor economics here can often lead to head of household suicides.... but I'm sitting here, still dreaming about him every now and then, having absolutely no way of getting in touch with him. Spent 24 years of my life being guided by this man who raised me to be the opposite of everything he did. How can I find him again? &gt;  &gt; I installed an email tracker app and saw that none of my emails to him were being opened. His extended family there is getting older and those that are in touch with the area say they haven't heard from him in years and don't know how to find him -- Including my aunt who he called every now and then initially. Should I hire a PI? Would that even work? At this point, I'm having mini freak outs where I just imagine I'm going to find out one day that he's passed away.

ckg3xoe,2g5uvj,Texss,"I know what you're saying but just like this current situation sometimes trouble just comes looking for you.  This was about 8 years ago and it was the summer between high school and college. I posted on a forum that was indexed by Google about how we had some friends and I had run from a party and posted &lt;local city here&gt; police suck.   A detective was searching on the internet and found the post, I had a link to MySpace in my forum signature so the detective was able to find out who I was and who my girlfriend was. This detective called me about a half dozen times threatening how he was going to prosecute me and basically trying to get me to admit to what I had done. One time he called while I was hanging out with friends so I answered on speakerphone, he thought I was recording the call and told me I couldn't record the call without his consent (which was not true considering we don't live in a dual consent state). He got fed up with me and called my girlfriends parents and no joke told them I was a drug dealer and I had inappropriate pictures of her on my Myspace.  Understandably upset I called his Lieutenant and told him how his detective was harassing me but the Lt wouldn't do anything about it. The calls did stop but about a month later I was in my third week of my freshman year in college and I got a called from my parents livid about wtf did I do to have four FBI agents show up at their front door asking for me by my MySpace username. I of course told them I had no idea not having putt the pieces together about how the two were tied together.  An FBI agent and a police lionize showed up at my dorm about a month later and questioned me for about an hour in my dorm hallway, then asked for my electronics which I voluntarily gave them even though they did not yet have a search warrant. The FBI then went on to question the people in my hall and my rooommate asking if they had ever seen any ""obscene"" photos on my computer. Definitely a good way to become infamous in my hall not even a month into the semester. My parents were freaked out and hired an attorney which was $5K just for the retainer. Eventually they subpoenaed my roommate in front of a federal grand jury. After that the FBI went silent for about 8 months until I got a call from my attorney, he told me that the FBI had closed their investigation and that he would be requesting my laptop and external harddrive back (which coincidentally enough was filled with a fair amount of pirate adult porn like MILFHunter, MyFriendsHotMom, MyFriendsHotSiter, etc).  When my dad received my electronics from the attorney he plugged in the harddrive and saw all of this he called asking me if the FBI had put those porn videos on my external or if I had actually had all that on there already. It was a pretty stressful year at school, my attorney told me if the FBI did decide to indict me that they would most likely find me in class to arrest me. So I sat in class not knowing if I was going to get hauled off on some bogus charges. Not to mention the fact I had projects due the week the FBI seized my laptop and had to explain to my professors that the FBI confiscated my computer. It was definitely quite the eventful but anticlimactic ordeal/freshman year.  I was glad to put everything behind me and I had stayed out of trouble as I typically do until this current series of events.

I have seen her one other time in two weeks (I went to go eat at the restaurant she works at yesterday -she did show interest, made me a paper football with a heart drawn on it and spent almost every chance she could with me) partly because we both work nights (really only have free time on the weekends) and live about a 30 -45 minute drive from each other. I don't want to ruin this but I'm not sure if she is just like that, and not a clinger, or if she is losing interest. The way she talks sometimes when I hint at things (I.e. kissing) is acknowledged in a positive and reciprocal way but I can't really tell as we don't see each other often. I don't want to seem like I'm all on her ass but I do have anxiety and mild depression (seriously fuck genetics) so I tend to over analyze everything when it comes to a romantic relationship. Thanks!!!",r

I am not made of stone.  I have been convincing myself to trust him again and again while each time I give him the benefit of the doubt, he goes back to acting the same and it is very hurtful.  I am having a hard time opening up now.  I don't remember the last time we had sex and I feel like I am not emotionally open with him like I used to be when we hang out.  Things are starting to feel tense and there are frequent awkward silences after we fight, and when we do talk it is not intimate.  I honestly feel like if depression were the case he wouldn't have such a vivacious social life, be constantly joking around with friends.

lwmuq,lwmuq,taway123123,"I'll try to make this short, but it's probably going to end up a bit long anyhow.  Sorry in advance.   **Background**: I'm in my late 20s, she's in her mid-20s, we're both otherwise stable and well educated. We both have competetive/stressful careers that demand a lot from us.  We've been dating a bit over a year, and things were absolutely amazing for the first 3-4 months.  After that, she kind of had a breakdown where she was feeling incredible anxiety about us.  We took a few weeks off over the holidays, and talked after about what we both wanted, and decided to give things another try.  Things went really well for another 3-4 months, and then the anxiety came back.  Since then, the anxiety has been intermittent, punctated with some really awesome times.  When things are good, we have a ton of fun together, relate extremely well, and otherwise have a great relationship.  We communicate extremely well, and have very similar goals.    However, when things are bad, they really suck.  She'll break down out of nowhere and feel incredibly anxious about our relationship, to the point where she feels she needs to do anything she can to get away from that feeling.  She says very hurtful things (*e.g.*, ""I don't know how I'm ever happy with you"" or ""I don't know if I'd be better off without you in my life""), which it turn make me hurt and insecure about our relationship and how she really feels about me.  After these, I'll feel a bit weird about things for a couple of days, which creates a pretty horrible feedback loop.  Generally, we'll make us, she'll tell me that she really does care about me and doesn't want to loose me, all that jazz, and that it's the anxiety that's the problem.  I'll question her on it sometimes, but generally I believe that she does want to be with me and that it really is a mental health issue.  Though she claims it's specifically about the relationship and committment, I've noticed that she's definitely at her worst when she's under additional pressure.  She's always been a worrier, but she's never had anxiety like this.  It's to the point where if anything is less than perfect (*e.g.,* one or both of us is really tired) she'll see that as cause to worry about how she feels, which will trigger her anxiety.  If there's nothing at present to worry about, she'll worry about how she might feel sometime in the future.  When she's calmed down and we talk about it, she'll feel bad about things, but she usually can't pinpoint anything in specific that set it off.  The best she's come up with is that she's afraid of me depending on her, which I find a bit odd since I'm generally a very independent person and feel I support her much more than she's ever supported me.  I hardly rely on her for any emotional support anymore because I'm not sure when she's going to spontaneously break down.  I avoid burdening her with any of my difficulties, but yet I am still her primary means of social support.  We saw a therapist together for a while about six months ago, and we had a few months with no anxiety where things were awesome, but I attribute that mostly to the fact that we both had relatively low-stress summers.  She started seeing a psychiatrist independently now, but after ~2 months things haven't really improved.   Does anybody out there have any experience with this?  This is a girl that I could see myself being with indefinitely *if* the anxiety were not such an issue.  Am I an idiot for continuing to try?  Any advice in general?  I'm kind of running out of ideas to try, and feel like I have to work soo hard to be the emotional support for both of us when I don't have anyone I can rely on myself.  **tl;dr:**  Been dating a girl with relationship anxiety for about a year.  Is there any chance that things could get better?",r

Number two: she obviously doesn't care at all  about your feelings and either of your friendships. Sorry if any of this is harsh... But seriously, this has bad, horrible trust issues written all over it. Anytime you see her talking to another guy, or texting someone, it WILL be in the pit of your stomach. Save yourself the time. Find a best friend who isn't trying to have two cakes, eat both, and tell everyone she hasn't had any. And this will be easier if you cut her off from your life 100%. Bottom line: if a girl/guy likes you genuinely enough, she doesn't want space, no matter how complicated, she doesn't want anyone else because she won't take the chance of ruining what she has or could have. It's a touch reality to face, but once you accept it, it's easier to move forward.",r

1og0jj,1og0jj,,"I started dating a friend of 3 years earlier in the summer. Things were going especially great for 3 months or so; we were both head over heels for each other. Great conversation, amazing sex, always making each other laugh, similar interests, etc. About a month ago, completely and utterly out of the blue, she tells me that she needs a to take break for a hot minute because things are feeling too heavy for her. So, I'm upset, but I give her the space she asked for. Not but 3 or 4 days later, she starts texting/emailing/facebook messaging me at least twice a day. At first, I wasn't reciprocating, and eventually, against my own good judgement, I started communicating with her again.  This goes on for the next few weeks. Gradually, she starts sending me risque texts and pics. That led to us sleeping together a few times over the last 2 weeks.   I talked to her after the first time we slept together after the break-up, stating how I felt about her and I, and how I wanted her back. She rebuffed me, but now I get more messages like, ""I like you a lot"", ""You're so great"", ""You're so hot"", etc. Now I'm extremely confused and my heart is in knots. I asked her, if she was so adamant about needing space, why doesn't she actually take her space? The only answers I get are totally vague. I'm basically just her pseudo boyfriend.   Anyway, I'm quite vexed about the entire scenario. I've talked to some friends about it. However, I'd like some other opinions. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",r

ev2h0,ev2h0,somefoolishfool,"So anyway, here's the situation as best I can summarize it for Redditors and I don't really know what the best thing to do about this is. She and I met about four years ago, in our early twenties and quickly found ourselves to really like each other. Then she got pregnant about three months into our relationship and our ""honeymoon period"" got artificially extended by the joys of expecting a first child. We lived a good distance away (what would normally be considered a long distance relationship), so I did some finagling with my job so I could move away from where I grew up to be in the right place to be a father to my child. Not only did I move away but I gave up a number of my passions to do it - people and passions I had lived with all my life. I'm not trying to downplay the number of sacrifices a new mother makes (she's made many and for that I'm thankful - I found a wonderful woman to be a mother to my child) but I literally gave up my entire life to go to a different place and be around her family as the ""guy who knocked up their daughter"". We moved in with her grandmother (her grandmother is in need of someone in the house constantly, so my girlfriend volunteered us to be those people). After about two years of that, we finally bought a house and moved out together. In the meantime though, we show a mutual lack of respect for each other and world views that differ greatly and have more and more difficulty simply getting along for extended periods of time. There is little intimacy or mirth in our relationship. As time goes on I feel less and less appreciated - I am still the only parent who is working and yet she often suggests things that cost us more money than we have right now (Christmas put us a little deeper on credit cards than I would have liked to have been, and will be the first time we've ever seen a finance charge due to credit card charges) and yet calls me out for being a grump when I turn down suggestions like going out to restaurants, entertainment, etc, and even goes so far as to text male friends of hers that we've had ""issues"" with in the past (emotional cheating via texting) about how I'm such a grump and how if it hadn't been for our wonderful son she'd never have any desire to be with me (which is fine). In addition to this she frequently undermines my values as a parent, allowing our son to do things when I've already told him ""NO"" instead of talking to me about it after our son is in bed so we can present a unified front to our son. More and more as time has gone on my son will more and more frequently go to her first and not be as interested in time with me if we are both around and available, which is depressing and disheartening. I'm not a strict guy but I want to make sure my son is raised to not be an entitled brat like so many kids I see out there. What can I do in a situation where we're obviously so unhappy? We've made no friends in our area due to the first two years of being stuck with her grandmother and not much ""getting out"" since then, so it's not like I have a close couch to crash on (nor do I want to simply bail out ... no need or desire for another deadbeat father in the world), but I can't continue the way we are with any form of sanity or happiness with my life as it is. I can expand more if I have to but I'm not really sure what I'm looking to say here. Advice, commentary, similar situations, anything is welcome. I just needed to get some things off my chest. Partially I just want help because I'm more and more depressed lately and don't want to progress to medication and/or end up in a hospital somewhere after some stupid act.

If that’s the case then you can still get a judge to look at the credit cards but you might have a harder time proving it was a diversion of funds. Like if he was using it for living expenses then it will be harder to convince a judge that it was a diversion - although if you can show that he used your identity without your knowledge to get the cards then that will get you a lot of the way there.  That will be pretty fact specific and you’ll want to consult a divorce lawyer about it.  Adultery *can* be a grounds for divorce in Texas which, greatly depending on the personal views of the judge, can win you a bigger settlement. Pursuing that rather than a simpler “no fault” divorce is a tactical decision that you’ll also need to speak to a lawyer about.",l
ofxt4,ofxt4,feelslikeajackass,"Hey everyone. Yes, this is a throw away because I know she frequents reddit (though hopefully not this subreddit)  I've had a relationship with this girl in question, let's call her ""Rebecca,"" for about a year this February.  At first we were just ""talking"" as they say, and her and my relationship dwindled quickly to nothing because of me spending time with my ex girlfriend (which admittedly is a bad move.) During this time, I was getting over my first ever breakup (it was also a very serious relationship) and I was trying to just find girls to keep me happy, and was fortunate the first one was great. I was not taking this part of the dating too seriously, which of course can seriously damage anyone.   She had been patient with me about the situation with my ex from the beginning, but around Easter we started talking a second time. Fast forward to July, and we are formally boyfriend and girlfriend, and I tell her that a girl I know (not my ex) had gotten a little sexual the first time around, and it destroys her (which I have already atoned for.)  Even so, me and my current girlfriend (Rebecca) have been in love since about May.  My girlfriend and I go through some tough times, and after a while things get straightened out and she is now actually due to move several states away in order to follow her ideals for school and work. I can't move for several months due to a family situation. The last few months, things have felt a little strange. We don't have sex nearly as frequently, and she doesn't really give me the looks like she actually wants me in any capacity. We have sex here and then, but it feels like a pity type thing. She DOES however look at me like she loves me, which is great, but it ends there. She has also recently broken up with me because of the fact that she is moving and the above mentioned ex bullshit and the second girl.  After a recent party, I check her texts, and it turns out she has a massive crush on a friend from my circle of friends which I have known for years. I also have constantly found porn on her computers history in the last few months after we haven't been having sex.  I believe the spark of attraction between her and I is lost. I love this girl, and want there to be hope, especially if she's moving up to new york, but it's scary to me to think that she can have this crush and completely lose any sort of attraction for me.  So my question is this:  Should I stay with her and try and be the best man I can be, romanticizing her and make her forget this crush and focus on us?  Or should I just forget about her and admit that so much has happened since I've known her, that her and I will simply not be possible anymore.  Writing this, I'm half angry and sad. I'm not proud that I checked her texts and computer history. She has checked my text countless times after the previous incidents with my ex and the issue with the other girl. I just felt that for this reason alone, if I felt I didn't trust her, I just wanted it to be justified.  Help me reddit, I don't want to make a wrong move on this one.",r

She at least owes you a meeting face to face to talk about this if it is indeed over.  When my husband and I were still just dating and we were separated for a month or two, we would always make sure to make time to have a quick phone call or e-mail. If you didn't do something like this, maybe it's possible she did just fall out of love a little and is doubting the relationship. Or maybe she met someone else while she was away.   Pick her up and arrange for a coffee date in a few days time where you can discuss this rationally. This way it gives you both a couple of days to think everything over after seeing eachother again.  You need to look out for yourself, even if it hurts. You shouldn't have to convince someone to love you and want you.  Good luck.",r

I had a pretty shitty childhood, and was basically self raised, so until pretty recently I dealt with all my problems internally, emotional or otherwise. Through spending time and building trust I’ve become slightly more open (though its still a big strain for me sometimes), and I love him for helping me grow in that way. The problem now is I feel like I’ve stopped growing. Neither of us is really moving forward in life, no real goals in mind. I feel like I need to be pushed to grow even more, and he is so laid back I’m afraid I’ll won’t get that from him. Our sex life has some what lost excitement for me, partly because I haven’t been getting off, and partly because I’m suddenly finding myself way way attracted to women. I am his first real girlfriend and devirginizer (lol) and sometimes I worry that he wants to go out a frolic in the vast field of vaginas (which I would be okay with I just want him communicate that) but on the other hand I’m also worried that maybe he’s completely and totally happy with me and I’m the one with all the problems.

8l5oof,8l5oof,elordanan,"Twelve years ago a property was purchased in a Florida subdivision which included a small preserve or natural wooded area.  Three years ago new neighbors subsequently destroyed the preserve, allegedly assuming from a realtor and/or the HOA Board that it belonged to them.  The Golf Club Manager was quoted as having approved of that action and, further, stated that all such preserves should be razed since they impacted the course and waterways negatively.   Neither the neighbors, the realtor, nor the management company has been cited with any wrongdoing by the Board, although both the covenants and Florida law were violated in the destruction of the preserve, an action also involving criminal trespass.   It became necessary to hire an attorney to force the HOA to allow the owner of the preserve to restore it.   The level of involvement of the Golf Club Manager is difficult to determine, but such reports leave one with little confidence that past actions have been harmless.  It is possible that the neighbors were misinformed in order to encourage them to purchase their property, which had become a predicament for the Board.  Their property had remained unoccupied for nine years with mounting complaints about its lack of maintenance.   During the ensuing conflict, the new neighbors revealed that they had purchased their property “as is,” an apparent deal to get the house occupied and maintained.  One Board member in particular was very aggressive in asserting that the owner of the preserve sell what was left of it to the neighbors, who insisted that they could not sell their house in the future without acquiring the parcel they had razed.  The Board member was coercive in his remarks and manner, and his behavior was supported by the two other committee members and Board liaison. The alleged opposition of the Golf Club Manager to the existence of such preserves as well as the necessity for a friendly relationship with Board members may have been motivators.  Despite their willful destruction of property and lying to the Board, the new neighbors were sympathized with and labeled “good people.”  They were completely exonerated and yet, in violation of the covenants, they had destroyed scores of trees, underbrush, and root systems without prior Board approval.  A substantial fine for such violations is mandated by the language in the covenants.  The Board is required to sue on behalf of all residents.  In this case the Board not only did not adhere to its own covenants but took decisive steps to prevent the owner of the preserve---who had not violated any covenants or statutes---from restoring the property.    These events may be regarded as a warning about Board members, Golf Club Managers, HOAs, management companies, and the wielding of power in order to advance special persons and their interests. Addendum:   Abutting the north end of the previously described preserve is Golf Club property.  Recently, that area has been cleared by the new neighbors of all bushes, underbrush, small plants, and grasses.  The Board and the covenants uphold strict regulations about such activity.  One must have an application approved in order to alter the slope or character of the land or compromise the stability of the soils, especially in proximity to easements and waterways.  It may be possible that the Golf Club Manager gave the new neighbors permission to clear the property, with or without the knowledge and permission of the Board.  Erosion of the land and encroachment on the waterway may result from this activity and can be a threat to proper drainage, an expressed and published concern of the Board.  Yet the above information details two separate events in which negative impact on the landscape and drainage system has been ignored by the very HOA that purports to be in charge of protecting that landscape and system.",l

I have no idea what to do, please give me some input on my situation..  I was never into dating girls in high school, just because I never met a girl I was interested in enough to actually date. Once I graduated and started college i met a girl in first semester, we became friends and i didn't want anything more until second semester. Once third semester started (third semester just ended 1 week ago) I was in love with her and she gave me signs to indicate she liked me back, there was only one problem, she had a boyfriend who she's been dating for 3 years. Once i was pretty certain she had feelings for me too, I had to know, so i told her how i felt. It turned out she liked me too, maybe even as much as I like her, but she was ""confused"".  For the last month I spent almost every weekday with her at school, and then after school. We text up words of 3500 texts a month, we're completely in sync, exact same interests, she's perfect for me. She lives in my city for school (with her boyfriend + roomates), but home for her is about an hour away and she just dropped out (she doesn't like our program) ..she's made it clear she wants to be with me, and i'd give anything to be with her but she doesn't want to break up with her boyfriend incase things with her and I don't work out, not to mention it'd be semi-long distance.  She told me last night she wants me to be where her boyfriend is, and essentially told me she's breaking up with him for me.. today she absolutely broke my heart when she told me she can't leave him..I'm devastated.  I just told her i can't do this anymore, it's too hard. i can't go through it again and that i can't talk to her anymore.  I have no idea what to do, i can't stop crying over her. Everything reminds me of her, and no matter what i do i can't get her out of my head. Please, how can I get over her?  TLDR; I'm 19, in love with a girl who's in a LTR. She wants to be with me too but doesn't want to throw away her current relationship, also she's dropping out of college (this program isn't for her) and her and I would be somewhat long distance. (1 hour away) I just told her i can't talk to her anymore after she broke my heart again. It hurts too much. How can I get over her?",r

c1r70b3,gy9p1,,"The plan doesn't sound terrible, but a lot of people couldn't handle someone who did this to them and readily accept them back. They would almost always have feelings of resentment, abandonment, and/or trust issues in that it may happen again.  With the both of you being each others first serious relationship it makes sense that she and even you would want to see what else is out there. Some people don't know how good they have it or what they want until they explore other possibilities.  One issue you are going to have to deal with if you two do get back together is her poor communication. She was with you for three years, but decided it would be better to cheat on you and leave vs telling you how she felt. If you think you can trust her again after that then go for it, but many couldn't.

ccakpdi,1mir5t,nyokarose,"Dude, I'm sorry, but you don't. :( one of the hardest parts of a relationship is that it takes 2 people, and one of the hardest parts of life is that you can't change the way someone else feels, no matter how much you want to. You can sometimes convince someone to do something you want, by asking or begging or manipulating, but you can never change how they feel and what they want to do deep down.   You need and deserve a relationship with a girl who wants to invest time in a relationship with you - and I'm going to make a sweeping generalization about my college relationships, and say you might need to make YOU the most important thing in your life. A healthy ""us"" is something that takes two people who love and respect themselves enough to know when they are getting the love and respect one deserves in a relationship.  Also, a LDR sometimes makes issues in transparency, intimacy, compatibility or life goals less apparent... So it's even more common for one person to think everything is fine while the other is growing in another direction.   Not that any of this makes it hurt less.

When I returned in August, my truck was gone. The hotel has  denied responsibility (“We have signs saying we are not responsible for loss or damage to vehicle or contents”).   They had security cameras in place but all cameras were pointed at the grass (the grass has behaved itself, to my knowledge).   The reservation was booked through way.com, who have also denied responsibility.   The truck and truck camper (a slide-in camper, NOT a trailer) are insured for “fair market value” but the contents were completely uninsured. The truck/camper value is about $40,000 and the contents are conservatively about $35,000. It remains to be seen what insurance will pay out for the truck.

Your home life sounds lack-luster and may be contributing to your other ""issues"", maybe getting out of there will help things out? Maybe you're just latching on to this person to make life more tolerable? - which brings me to, if he's not filling needs, keep in minds it's an LDR, and that's the nature of LDRs  If you're really certain you love him, I'd recommend saving every dime nickel and penny to move closer to him, work your ass off and save it before it dies, before the distance kills the relationship. But if you're confused about it, you may also need to iron things out before progressing.  Break-ups are never pain-free. It's impossible to ""let them off easy"", you will be waiting for years for the right thing to say at the perfect moment. Once more, ask yourself, are you certain you love this person? It isn't fair to them if you want to breakup, you deserve to be happy and he deserves someone who gets enough out of him.  There is something about traveling and foreign places that bring a fantastical attraction about people, you may just be a close friend that fell for some of that ""magic travel lust"", hard to say with as few details as you've provided  Hopefully this advice is what you were looking for, -Arrancar4",r

1oxcyo,1oxcyo,,"Hey reddit,  I met this woman about 8 months ago where she works at a local coffee shop. At the time she had a boyfriend.   She broke up with him about 3 weeks ago.  Yesterday we got to talking and she asked if I wanted to hangout. I told her to wait a few hours so I can run some errands and we'll go get some good. I offered to pay.   It went really well, there was hardly a lull in conversation other than when we were shoveling food down our gullets. We laughed and had a great time. Afterwards I asked if she wanted to do a movie, my treat and she was all for it.   As we were walking into the theatre she asked ""this isn't a date, is it?"". I did think it was, but I told her ""no, you and I are in neither spot in our lives for a relationship"" which is true on some level for the both of us.   The movie was okay (Carrie remake). 5/10  When I dropped her off at her apartment, she said she had fun, would like to do it again, and gave me a hug.   Later that night she said She still thought I was cute (we hadn't seen eachother in about 4 months or so).   So, reddit, obviously there is some mutual interest on some level here. However, she's not ready for a relationship and I get that. How do I show that I'm interested in her on a more than friends basis without crossing boundaries or getting friend zoned?  TLDR: I like a girl, I think she likes me, I'm impatient and scared of getting friend zoned if I don't make my interest in her clear. How do I go about this is a respectful way?",r

You have a couple of seconds to notice and usually all it takes is to startle them and they'll recover again. But sometimes supplemental oxygen could be required.

My sense is she is not being honest with you.  Your telling her that you are having panic attacks and not sleeping in an attempt to garner her respect of you is a super bad pattern to start and it means your already having to try to use guilt on her to manage this relationship and get what you need and your still not getting it.

wp8et,wp8et,hypabo,"Ok Reddit. I'll try to make this short and to the point.  I 32/m met an amazing 25/f earlier this year and started seeing her in May. Things were amazing right away. She expressed her desire to take things slowly as she really wasn't on the lookout for anything serious and I obliged. Regardless we spent tons of time together (5 days out of 7 most weeks) she would sleep over. For all intents and purposes we were in a serious relationship minus the title.   A couple of weeks ago I approached her regarding what we were as I had questions, also I felt like we were at that point and just needed to have the talk. She expressed the same wishes that she had before... She was scared and wanted to go slow. I respected that, especially because at the same time she told me that I was all she thought about and could see a future with me more than she had with anyone before.   Unfortunately this happened at a bar, and I had a couple in me (not a lot) as did she. I made the mistake of telling her that I was in love with her... something I promised myself not to do.   I spent the next day trying to dig myself out of the hole and in the process just making things worse. We have seen each other a couple of times since then and while they didn't go poorly they just weren't the same either. I know she has feelings for me and I know that she is incredibly frustrated with me, as I am with myself. I am meeting her today to exchange some of each others items that we had.   My plan is to meet her at a neutral location, have a couple cold beers with me and offer her to sit. I plan on being very laid back about the whole thing and not putting any pressure on her at all. I need to straighten everything out as I have said things out of frustration and also said things that didn't come out the way they were intended. I am going to try to prepare myself for her to tell me that she is finished with me yet also hopeful that her feelings are still strong enough to try to get this to work.   This girl is perfect for me, I don't want anything more than what we had or what she is ready for. She is worth waiting for. Any advice??

It doesn't matter what the fight is about or how small it is, it always results in him screaming and yelling and name-calling.

Let me give an example (and essentially the reason why I am posting about this because it just happened). We went into town to go for a walk and browse some shops. On the way there I brought something up just to make conversation and he immediately started arguing about it and when I told him that I didn't agree with him and that he didn't really know as much about the subject as I did, he blew a gasket. He was screaming at me in the car and jumped out of the car and ran off. I parked and waited for a few minutes and then drove down the street and rolled down the window and asked him to get in. He flipped me off and kept walking. I called him and he wouldn't answer the phone. I texted him and said this was ridiculous and asked him to call me. He told me to fuck off. So I went home. He then showed up (im assuming took a taxi) a half hour later and when I tried to discuss what happened, he started screaming at me (so much that the neighbors above pounded on the floor), told me he hates me and hates dating me, called me names and proceeded to delete me as his girlfriend on facdebook.

c3b85h3,nmwaj,ijustpooped,"""The worst part is just that this has happened so many times that i have a hard time externalizing the problem and always saying ""it's her loss,"" ""i'm awesome,"" etc. etc... After the same thing happens so many goddam times, doesn't it make sense to look inside and ask myself, ""hey, this keeps happening. maybe i'm missing something; maybe i'm doing something wrong; what can i do to avoid having this happen again? what would i need to be like or look like or act like to get her to open up to me?""""  What would you like to happen?  I had this same problem for a long time and it was because I never made the first move at the right time.  It's tough and you will sometimes get rejected, but I think this is what might be missing here.  ""i haven't given up yet. but like i said, if i'm friendzoned then so be it; i like her and feel closer to her than i have some of my actual past girlfriends, and i wont let my ego or hormones or rampant emotions or the fact that i'd like to be able to hold her hand on a regular basis ruin this friendship that i've come to value so much.""  It sounds like you really like this girl.  The problem is that if you are friend-zoned, you may end up setting yourself up for some real heart-ache later (I've been there).  5 or 6 years ago I started talking with this girl online.  She was great and after awhile I asked her out and we went on a few dates.  Things went pretty well.  After a few weeks she eventually told me that she didn't see me in that way.  The problem? she kept calling me every other week, telling me her problems, calling me ""sweetie"", and giving me signals like she really liked me.  I let it drag on for at least another year (it might have been more like 2) like this.  Finally, I got tired of it and started dating other women.    She calls me up crying and tells me that she thought I ""replaced"" her.  When I tried to explain how I felt, she got super defensive.  It didn't end well and I eventually just told her that I wouldn't allow it to go on like this any longer and I haven't really spoken to her since.  My problem is that she would have let this go on for a long time.  She was getting all the emotional support she needs from a relationship without any of the physical aspects of it.  She just wasn't mature enough to stop it right then and there.  However, even at that time, I knew that it wasn't right to lead someone on like that.  I felt like a sucker and it still makes me a little angry thinking about it because I could have prevented so much heart-ache later if I would have just cut it off.  I guess you live and learn.",r

1butvs,1butvs,bestgirlfriend,"So the bf and I bought a house together.   It's great however; when we talk about what we would like to do to the house as far as cosmetic we end up fighting.  In the beginning he had told me and his mother that I was in charge of the paint and colors.  He wanted no part into it.  I agreed. I also had tried to get his opinion about the colors but he said he was stressed from the thought so I took it into my own hands. That was no problem.  Fast forward to the paint on walls.  He hated the colors and criticized my paint job.  This hurt my feelings.  I am not an expert painter at all nor had  really painted many rooms before. I had got paint on ceiling but it was touched up.  Some got on the trim but I had wiped it off. Normally if it was anyone else it would t have bothered me however I took real offense. He told me to do it so I did to the best of my knowledge and skills. I was really proud of my colors and job done. It was not perfect but I felt it was pretty good.    Next was the way I set up the kitchen.  Once again he told me he did not care how I did it. So his mom and I unpacked, put away, and cleaned the room up.  Now he pisses and moans about where I put things and how it's a not the way it should be.    Next our bedroom.  I had bags of cloths I put in the closet to the side.  He had a shelf he was going to get for me.  So he got the shelf tore the bags out left them on the floor and put the shelving up. I greatly appreciated so however; I was in the middle of another project and had to go to work the next morning and went to bed early.  The next day he bitches about the bags of cloths on the floor.    Then the bathrooms need to be painted and once again that's my job. I am fine with that but he had said he would take care of the pulling trim off of walls and patching what needs to be patched.  He does not want me to do it for he wants it do e ""right"" and does not want me to do it ""wrong"". He has not done so yet but makes comments about how the bathrooms are not done yet.   I understand this is all a stressful time but I hurt and often have been silently crying in bed and wondering if I made the right choice. My heart says yes and my brain does too but questions if I always want to feel I am doing wrong.  I know communication is the key and we normally have great communication. I just don't know how to express my words and thoughts so he will understand how I feel without hurting him. Help please.",r

gff84,gff84,,"So I just came to terms with being single and it is amazing. All I want to do is have as much fun as possible, and there's a boy in a few of my classes who reeks of this sexy indifference that I often see in some people and get abnormally excited about.  I've no idea where I stand, because the most we've talked about is subjects and contact has been minimal. I realized he was in my class too late in the beginning of the semester and I paired with someone else for assignments on the first day.  It's one of those situations where you kind of see someone, and instantly want their package. No real lead up.   The furthest I've gotten is the initiation of a brief conversation. He was saying that he couldn't connect to the wireless and I whored myself as a resource. What's next? Sharing snacks?  I just want to know if you think it's bad if I write a memo. I'm kind of blunt, so it'd probably say something like ""Hey, I like your mustache. Wanna bang?"".   I really just want to do this in a normal way though. I have this incapacitating fear that he has a girlfriend, and he probably does even though I've heard no word of it yet. We're both members of a forum which we use for help with our programming subjects, which is how I initially came into contact.  The normal but less energy efficient way of doing this would be to sit next to him in my lab and ask many friendly questions. I then have this plan where I find out if we like the same music and pretend I need someone to come to a concert with me. One is coming up that I know of, but time is running out!  I guess my real question is, how to decide if someone will be indifferent to your advances. He never initiates conversation, though that could just be that he's shy (and indifferent). He is polite and friendly and seems happy when I ask him things in class, though that could just be because he's engaging. I'm getting steamy here.  How do you level up in a getting-to-know-you game?  My second last idea would be to find him in the corridor, and ask if he has a girlfriend. I just don't have a plan for if he says yes or no.  I need ideas for plans. Places to go that aren't boring would be really awesome. I live in a temperate zone, but it's moving into winte and is coolish.  I want to make friends before the big holidays, but I'm running dry on normal ways to start a lengthy conversation because he either arrives after I leave class (one of them isn't compulsary) or he sits next to groups he just kind of floated into in class.

u9pnh,u9pnh,,"I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years last night. It's the first gf I have broken up with. I am such a resilient person to emotional pain, but it went too far, or too long.   My gf was amazing 60% of the time. She was such a valued addition to my life. I have known her for 15 years and I have always liked her. We stopped talking for 5 years because she was pissed off I didn't ask her out, but 2 years ago she finally accepted my Facebook friend request, and from then it begun.   To make things clear: she said she was in love with me. Well, she IS in love with me. The problem is, she had some attitude issues that would get in the way of showing me her love. But when she did, it was magical between us.  To me, she was the one that got away, and I was never going to let her through my fingers again. I love this girl with all of my heart. There is nothing more I want than to be with her for the rest of my life, even though I am only 22.  The problem: 40% of the time she has a serious attitude problem. She has anger issues and takes it out on me. I put up with her shit for a year, but what eventually got to me was the fact that she never listened to seeme to learn from her mistakes.  The final blow: she helped me with some Uni homework one night and I let her borrow my favorite pillow. When I took it back, se asked if she could have it again. I jokingly said ""you can't always get what you want"" and then she left, not overly angry. She started calling me names like ""cunt"" which I knew weren't serious name calling because thats just her, im ok with it for a bit, but she didn't stop, she kept calling me names to the point where I just didn't know what to say. So I ignored her, unfortunately she was ok ignoring me. So I asked her to please stop with the name calling. She didnt.  To me, that was the tipping point. I knew I couldn't take any more of her crap, she is a wonderful person, but she can also be nuts.  I broke up with her after 2 years. I know I made the right decision, but I miss her already and I broke up with her even though I love her.  I'm hoping one day in the future we may reunite, when she has finally grown up a bit.

This required a lot of arguing and the owner was being really reckless (I have email evidence to prove). With the destruction being completely his fault, he even had the nerve to tell us we would have to pay for the extra material required to re-build the fence! Over the 5 months, the wooden fence was left by the company on the ground - where I live we get every type of precipitation so it noticeably ruined the wood. Anyways, I finally got them to come in and they agreed to do it at no charge. I get back home today and the fence is definitely not in the state it was prior to the destruction. There are huge gaps at the bottom of the fence from the ground which is causing mass garbage being blown onto our property. In addition, the entire fence is not enforced property and moves with the touch of a finger.  Can someone please advise me as to what I should do next?  Some additional information if it helps, the day they accidentally broke down the fence, they failed to inform us (the homeowners) of the damage they have caused.

I'm usually an emotional person however I only cried for a minute or so on Thursday night so bottled in the emotion. On friday after finishing university I went over to my girlfriends and we had an argument (I thought she was acting off). I ended up being very mean (saying that her friend uses her etc). My girlfriend told me to drop it and I didnt I kept going this basically ended in her splitting up with me.  On friday I left and ended up driving back over to her flat. I apologised and said i'm sorry. However she told me it didn't matter as I shouldn't have done that. She says I do it all the time and we're in a rut (we currently aren't having sex). I asked if we would ever get back together and she said no.

c1a66ve,eqnin,knighter50,"Whoa there, cowboy. Let's step away from the L word until you actually have something happening between you two. If you jump at someone with such strong words before you're even in a relationship, you could easily scare them away, even if they have feelings for you.   This isn't complicated at all. You're just rusty reading signs. Look at the facts: She touches you, finds comfort in you, takes you to see her family, talks about past relationships with you (meaning the subject of dating has been on her mind), and calls you daily.   Two possibilities. 1) SHE FUCKING LIKES YOU. Things moved so fast between you two because y'all had an instant, mutual attraction.  2) You're sooo deep in the friend zone, you're practically a best friend. Things moved so fast because you present a personality trait that is nonthreatening, like seeming so gentle and awkward that the thought wouldn't even cross her mind or gay.   My bets are on #1, ESPECIALLY because she shared the faults of past relationships (as to, as you guessed, hint to you). But only YOU would know if #2 applies, because I don't know either of you. A solid sign of #2 would be over-consistently referring to you as ""a friend"" or talking about other current love interests.   You don't need to ""push"" any of this. You just need to take action. Do what you're doing, keep being her friend, but create situations that foster the possibility of things leading to a kiss and growing closer. Eat alone with her, go to the movies/bowling/[cliche date location] with her...   If things are still so shady and answers don't come to you naturally, COMPLIMENT HER. Her reaction to your compliment will tell you everything, whether she acts flattered, surprised, or even compliments you back. Then, if you feel comfortable, absolutely do not be afraid to just say, ""I like you."" And see what she has to say. It's all about communication.  You work with her, so it's not like your'e never going to see her again. Nonetheless, keep my most stated guideline in mind: The more casual and confident you act, the more at ease she will feel. It can sometimes be a direct correlation-- you have reasonable control over the situation. (In the same manner, the more awkward you act, the more awkward she will feel.)",r

But assuming, like the computer, the central heating unit is toast, what would be a fair price to ask for reimbursement  given that the unit is very old (not sure how old, but possibly 20,30 years, maybe more, all I know is it looks really old but it does its job.)   and clearly is not worth what a new unit is worth,  or even any available used units?

I went through something similar not too long ago; when my girlfriend and I started dating, it heralded the end of a two year single-by-choice slut-a-thon. All the romance was there (which is what I sorely missed for two years), but she had ZERO sexual experience whatsoever - not even porn - and adapting to that from what I was used to previously was like jumping in a frozen lake after sitting in a sauna.  However, what convinced me it was worth it was seeing all the sacrifices she made for my sake; we were BOTH struggling equally hard to make it work. The vast majority of failed relationships fail because of an imbalance - one person likes the other less, one does too much work compared to the other, etc.  Tell her that, while you like her a lot, it's not fair to any person under any circumstances to be cut off from their friends - see her just as often, but make it clear that if things are going to work, you both need to curb-stomp any feelings of jealousy so you can just simply enjoy each other's company.",r

jafsm,jafsm,SamD38,"So here's the scenario, myself and my girlfriend have been going great for about a year and 10 months, we never argue, weve never broken up before and Ive felt things for her Ive never felt for anyone. We both just finished our firts year of university, we lived about an hour from each other on the train which wasnt too bad and we saw each other a lot. Recently however we have been seeing a little less of each other. So today the worrier inside me asked if she thought everything was okay. She said no. She said she was young and at uni and didnt want to feel like she was missing out on any university experiences. She was also worried about doing well in her studys and that spending too much time with me would damage her grades. This was a shock to the system since I'd never really had any dounts. She also said that she really does see herself being with me in the future (were really very close in our relationship) but doesnt want to miss out on anything at uni. I asked her what she would be missing out on by being in a relationship with me, what could she gain by being single that she couldnt gain by being with me. She beat around the bush a little here but its pretty obvious really, she wants to enjoy being single at uni, at least for now but she also wants me as a backup. She said 'i do see myself being with you but at the same time i feel like i'm really young and at uni and want to be single atm if that makes sense and i understand i cant have it both ways because thats totally unfair'. We talked a little more and we are not on a break yet, I told her to step back, think about what we could lose and sleep on it. She agreed and she is coming through to see me this weekend so we can talk about it face to face.   If Im honest, I genuinely believe that what she is telling me is true, she always goes on about our future together and she talks about it like its a certain thing. I asked her straight if this whole going on a break thing was a way of letting me down gently before she breaks it off completely in a month or so, she said no.  So when she comes through this weekend how do I approach it? I dont want this break and I want to convince her that it wont help our relationship, its not practical at all considering we could lose so much. Any help is massively appriciated you guys.

f6jqb,f6jqb,helpmesavemymarriage,"Hi.  My wife and I have been married almost 20 years.  We've had some great times, some good times, some tough times and some really tough times... but right now I think we're really on the ropes.  There are sexual symptoms but I don't suspect that's the root cause of the problem.  Essentially, our mismatched libidos have led to disconnection, resentment and more worryingly, reduced communication.  She' says she's almost always *willing* to receive my advances but, until she's almost ready to climax, I have to do absolutely everything while she barely moves at all, with zero feedback or constant negative feedback (like, body language that suggests boredom, looking zoned out, frequently readjusting herself or asking me to stop and start again).  What happens from this is that I draw the conclusion, quite rightly I think, that she doesn't want to make love. The last thing I want to do is force her in that situation, so I'll stop, and then we'll argue because she thinks that by not saying ""no"", she's done her part, and I should have just carried on.  Sometimes I try, but her feedback makes me lose my erection, or just feel full of hate and anger.    We've talked it to death, tried having serious debates, and we've had some massive arguments.  I try to be the best husband I can possibly be - she gets unexpected romantic gifts and gestures (like, for Christmas, one of her gifts was a set of little cards I had printed each a with different memory of one of our good times together)  Mind you I screw it up sometimes too - as well as those I gave her several presents that take batteries if you know what I mean - we've had some great times with that sort of play before but it didn't go down well at all.  Some other info to help sincere advisors:  * we have young children, more than most.  My wife is always extremely tired looking after them.  I do everything I can when I'm home to help with domestic chores and whatever  * as you might guess, we both have some (shared, not entirely dysfunctional) religious background (that's an understatement really).  However, we've had a much more fulfilling relationship physically in the past, even significantly adventurous stuff.  But now, it's like she's forgotten how to be sexual. She says she just feels stupid all the time and upset and angry when she think's I'm going to make advances towards her.  The primary effect of our belief system on this issue is that she would not consider it acceptable for me to masturbate to relieve tension, and that viewing pornography together (which would arouse her libido, and has done in the past) would produce more guilt in the long term and would therefore not be beneficial.  * I work away from home several nights a week.  This problem has been evident for a couple of years though, predating that situation.  Additionally there's absolutely no chance there's somebody else for either of us.  Various circumstances mean that's absolutely not a possibility.   So, reddit, please help.  What have I missed? What flaw have I exposed in my actions or thoughts or deeds that are making things so terrible? She says she loves me, swears blind she does.  I mention in passing, ""ooh, I fancy a blueberry muffin"", forget about it, and next day she's bought me one.  She even gives *me* flowers.  I think she does love me, but she won't express it in bed, although we've been great together before.  It's like she's just been disconnected from her sexuality, and it's killing our marriage.  If some dreadful negative sexual thing had happened recently like an assault or whatever, that would be a valid explanation, but I've outright asked and watched sensitively for any indications like that, but there are none.  Maybe just writing this will be cathartic enough.  We had a massive argument today and she said she feels like she's stuck in a pit with a rope that keeps being dangled down to her but when she tries to climb out it's pulled away.  I promised her that  tonight I'd get her out of that pit but I don't know how.  Currently my plan is to return home  share a nice meal together, and try and suggest she has a bit to drink (that has helped in the past, but now she fears the suggestion as much as a sexual advance) and watch a film that has always turned her on in the past and somehow lead her to the bedroom for a night of passion... yeah, naff plan I know.  What should I do reddit?  **Tl;dr: we've had a great marriage in every dimension including physically.

ic9jw,ic9jw,gettingthegirl,"So she's a co-worker and we've been working together for about half a year now. Since three months or so she started asking me all those personal questions i.e. all the places I've worked or resided. Of which I covered about 40% explaining to her that I came around a lot due to the fact that my family moved abroad when I was a young teen. It seemed to arouse some serious interest in my character on her part. Before, we were pretty much talking about work related stuff only or mostly teasing each other in a manner of which I thought was nothing else but friendly. Recently she asked wich clubs I frequent, how much cigarettes I smoked a day and what tatoos I got ( haven't shown them yet since one of them is 420 related ). So the time came to grow some balls. I asked her if she'd like to grab some drinks with me as we were leaving from work and she said yes without much hesitating. We had a really good time talking and enjoying each other's company. She didn't look at her clock once and so it happend that she missed her last train. So I walked her home ( about a 40 min walk ) and we kept talking even stopping in front of her home for another 30 minutes.

45z227,45z227,sublettinglegal,"Yes, I realize I'm an idiot here. Technically a verbal contract and there is a paper contract he is unwilling to sign.  I have rented a house for a one year lease beginning in January 2016 of this year and ending in January 2017 of the following year. I rented this house under the foolish assumption that a friend of mine would be joining me in February and splitting the cost of the house. We discussed this extensively for several months, I created a contract, and everything seemed to be fine.   I am unable to afford the rent for this house otherwise, and it was understood between the two of us that I would be dependent on his portion of the rent to pay for the lease.  However, a day after moving in, this ""friend"" is now regretting his decision to move out of his parents house and wants to back out of this subletting arrangement. This however, leaves me in a situation where I am unable to pay the full year rent for this lease and will be desperately attempting to find a roommate to cover the costs that this friend would have been covering.  Is my friend financially obligated to pay for the rent that he promised to pay until January 2017? Can he back out without any repercussions or financial penalties?

98w59y,98w59y,smitcal,"TL/DR - have depression/anxiety and been on a support plan while that was diagnosed. I have asked not to be in the support plan as it’s causing more anxiety, this was ignored and now I have failed my plan and in a worse place mentally than I have been for a while.    I’m just looking for advice, I was put on a support plan back in April as I was struggling with work, wasn’t able to think properly, wasn’t able to keep the quality of my work up which resulted in this support plan. During all this time I was visiting a counsellor through work.  In May I visited a psychotherapist which just sent me over the edge and I realised I was suffering and suffering badly. I immediately went off work that day and was off for a month with anxiety/depression. When I came back I wasn’t able to see customers as it had been over a month I was off and I had to do a small retrain to be able to see customers again. I was much better than I had been in a long time. Anyway after a couple of weeks I was put back on the support plan and this has gradually increased my anxiety again to even bigger proportions to now I have failed the support plan and will be sent to a disciplinary with potential of a first written warning.   I had mentioned repeatedly while I was on the support plan that it was causing anxiety and making me worse, and even asked recently if I could just have breather of a month to show that I can do the job but when someone is watching every move I make and asking me to explain everything I do with the threat of a disciplinary over me is making it much harder and I would be prone to mistakes. I was just told the plan will finish soon and a decision will be made from there.  Now I don’t want to cry all depression and obviously I will biased but I just find this a really unfair process. It’s pushed me to the point where I now need medication which I was doing me best to hold off on but it’s got to the point where it’s needed.   It’s now down as a disability and I can request reasonable adjustments to be made however I don’t know what reasonable adjustments are  but was hoping asking for the support plan to be removed would have been one as it is causing and making things worse.",l

gbssm,gbssm,tlowens,Just over two months ago I ended a 2 year relationship and I think it may have been the biggest mistake I have ever made.  We're still very close and see each other a lot (I think this may be the problem). I get insanely jealous when she is hanging around other guys and I'm basically going insane. I call her when I'm drunk all the time and I just hate whats happening to me.  Any advice on how to get over it?,r

gblix,gblix,,"Not sleeping as in sex, literally sleeping with her in her bed.  Let's just say I've been in this situation before, had platonic female friends whose beds I slept in.  Well, this girl and I's friendship started when I was dating someone else and she came up to me in high school and said she had a dream where she kissed me.  I just sat there jaw dropped because 1) I was in a relationship and didn't wanna put my foot in my mouth, 2) this girl is waaaaaay hot and I couldn't imagine in a million years her saying this to me.  Anyways, fast forward a few years, we haven't been talking the whole time but about 8 months ago we started hanging out again.  Last night, we started drinking and she asked if I wanted to sleep in her bed tonight...with her.  I've barely so much as hugged this girl and I was dumbfounded.  I said yes.  I didn't go in assuming ""yeeeah dawg gonna git me sum"".  I know better.  I lay in the back, back-down, left arm behind my head, right arm at my side.  No touching.  She turned on some Bon Iver and started going to sleep, or so I thought.  Later she propped herself up on her arms, looked at me and asked if the music was bothering me, or if I didn't like it.  I said no.  Then she laid back down, this time her knees curled up against my leg, her arms against mine, head resting on the opposite side of her elbow.  Okay...she's never been very cuddly before.  We're both drunk and I still don't assume anything.  I turn over because I remember I can't sleep on my back, but I face her just to see if anything happens without really asserting anything.  I lay like that for about 10 minutes (I have trouble falling asleep quickly anyways), and when I was starting to drift, I hear her wake up for a second, facing me, make this little laugh, turn around.  Then she took my arm and wrapped it over her and pushed herself back into my body.  We lay like that for I don't know how long.  Didn't stay that way the whole night though, since it was really hot (temperature wise).  I couldn't bring myself to say anything this morning and she had to work at 11, then again at 4.  She sent me this text an hour or so ago:  ""So hey. Last night was wrong.  I crossed the boundary of friendship by inviting you to sleep with me.  Sorry.""  I thought the wording was interesting, since it wasn't the ""we're just friends"" ""we'll only be friends"" I'm so used to getting.  It took me about 30 minutes to think of a reply: ""I mean..do you have any sort of feelings for me?""  I didn't want to let the conversation die at the first text.  I'm a volatile mixture of excitement and confusion at this moment.  It seems obvious she has something for me, but I've thought that before and been incredibly wrong.  Help. :(",r

dyi2qwu,8h9edz,veemondumps,"Since I saw your other thread here is the answer to your question: maybe.  You read an article on a website that details corporate best practices.  Best practices dictate that you don't ask a potential employee if they own a car because the question may be discriminatory under certain circumstances, whereas if you rephrase the question as ""do you have reliable transportation"" then you have no potential liability.  But just because something isn't a best practice doesn't mean that its discriminatory.  Whether it is or is not discriminatory is highly fact specific to both you and the specific employer that asked you the question.  And what makes it discriminatory is whether the employer in question was attempting to use the question as a backdoor for racial discrimination.  If you think that the previous employer who asked you the question did so because they did not want to hire you due to your race then contact an employment lawyer or report it to the EEOC.  If it happens again and you again feel that the reason for asking the question was to backdoor racial discrimination then, again, contact an employment lawyer or report it to the EEOC.",l
8nkgjq,8nkgjq,OrzBrain,"This is a parcel in an out of the way place in the mountains outside the Bay Area in California. I've been leasing the place for more than a decade now from sort of a family friend (well, the people I'm dealing with now are more the daughter and granddaughter of the friend, since they passed away). They said they wanted to sell the place and offered me first bid at the price they said it was assessed at in the grandmother's will, $113,000 cash for 113 acres with a cabin on it which I am currently living in.  I was busy with some stuff for nearly a year after they first offered, and they didn't press much, but more recently they said that unless I was willing to go through with it they needed to start showing it to other potential buyers, so I agreed to make the purchase. They said they would have their lawyer contact me and draw up the paperwork.  This was supposed to be a friendly transaction, with little in the way of mutual suspicion of either side trying to do wrong. However the stuff I'm getting that the lawyer wants me to agree with is rather less friendly, and is starting to make me paranoid. Here's a copy of their terms and conditions, with identifying info redacted:  &gt;Thank you for your e-mails to both myself and [owner]. We appreciate you letting us know your mindset and thought process.  With that being said, we want to be sure we are all on the same page before we deposit your $16,950.00 check and move forward with the preparation of the paperwork.   &gt;Please confirm that you agree to the following terms of the sale of the property:   &gt;1.	The property will be purchased and deeded “as-is,” which includes any and all issues of title, easements, or other potential issues with the property.  At the same time, no inspections of the property will be made, which means you won’t need to do anything with your property to accommodate the sale. &gt;2.	The purchase price shall be $113,000.00. &gt;3.	Fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price ($16,950), which has already been furnished to [owner], will be used as an initial good faith down payment, with the remainder (85% or $96,050) due within three (3) days of your signing of the sales paperwork. &gt;4.	The parties will share the cost of the preparation of all purchase/sale and deed documents, and the cost for any and all associated transfer taxes, recording fees, and other costs that may arise. Your one-half (1/2) will also be due within three (3) days of your signing of the sales paperwork.  When we send you the purchase agreement and a draft of the deed, we will let you know the cost. &gt;5.	The remainder payment and your one-half (1/2) of the costs will be paid by check made payable to “[lawyer firm name]” and mailed to my office at the address below along with your signed purchase/sale document(s). This check must be paid in full within three (3) days of you signing the purchase agreement and will be deposited into our client trust account for the benefit of [owner]. &gt;6.	You commit to reviewing and signing the purchase agreement within fifteen (15) days of me sending it to you by both mail and e-mail.  Please provide me with the best mailing address for you.   &gt;Once we receive your final commitment to these terms, I will begin preparing the purchase agreement and deed.   &gt;I look forward to hearing from you.  If I do not hear from you by Monday, June 4, we will move forward with another buyer.  This is starting to sound a bit weird to me. High deposit, and now all this ""due within three days"" crap. I live in a really rural area, the mail delivers and picks up only twice a week here, and sometimes gets delayed. Not to mention that I have a tremor, so my signature has changed a bit over time, and I can't completely guarantee my checks will cash without some sort of holdup.  I've known the family for years, and I am pretty confident that there isn't something like a bunch of back taxes owed on the property or a cloudy title (and I did a little checking at the county records website and it looks clean), but this is still sounding odd to me.

kzf9m,kzf9m,,"I'm a 20 year old male who's currently on a placement year in Japan. I got here just over two weeks ago and a few days ago I realised I'm getting a bit lonely. Also, she (21) is off having fun in a familiar place and all I'm really doing is going to work and going home, with the odd tourist thing every now and then - no friends yet. Btw, I've been told before that I tend to overthink things, so the problem might be more that I just need to try to chill the fuck out.  One problem is, she tends to make friends easily with guys rather than girls. So, lately there's been a load of guys she's added on facebook. It bothers me a little but I get what she's like, and I understand she can easily say no to guys. What's been bothering me since friday is that some pictures were posted with her looking very coupley with a guy who she's recently made friends with - housemate - along with some comments as such. I feel like I shouldn't be bothered but I really am, and at the moment I'm going around feeling crappy all the time, struggling to eat and not really sleeping. I told her that I'm feeling lonely and that I'd like her to talk to me more, and that the picture bothered me. Her response was to start taking the piss because I was getting jealous, and pretty much told me to stop whining. Now i get that yes, I'm not being the most attractive guy right now: women want a guy who has high self-esteem and everything right? Well, thing is, I'm in a completely different country, struggling to speak the language and hardly talking to my girlfriend. Also, just tonight that guy changed the picture to his profile picture and she's liked it. What I think I need is some reassurance from her that things are okay and that she's not interested in any other guys. But now it feels like I can't tell her this because otherwise I'm just gonna end up pushing her away more. Also, her response has been instead to try to encourage me to go make friends by saying she won't talk to me much, in order to encourage me to talk to other people. That'd be fine if I wasn't already having a hard time. It's support, but not the kind that I think I need right now. I just want her to reassure me that things are okay and talk to me a bit more, and show more of an interest in me.  I'm madly in love with her, and our relationship has had some big bumps in the past but we always ended up getting back together. I love her personality because it's quite different from mine - I'm an introvert and she's an extrovert. But it scares me, and I always worry that any second she's going to up and leave me.  There's another thing which has started to bother me lately though as well, which kinda ties in with it. Before I left she mentioned that she's expecting me to get with a Japanese girl/girls whilst I'm over here, but if I do then I shouldn't tell her. It worries me because it makes me think that maybe she's planning to get with guys whilst I'm away and keep it from me. I don't think she's really that kind of person but I'm not so sure. In addition, in the past she's been the one to bring up the idea of a threesome with a girl (she's bisexual) and once she even started a conversation about an open relationship, although I don't definitely remember her saying whether she was interested in one or not. but now I'm thinking she might not have because I was opposed to the idea before she got the chance to say. So basically I'm also worried that she might cheat on me, and if she's open to the idea of cheating on me then she's open to the idea of getting a new boyfriend. Am I just overthinking things?  So, basically I'm worrying that she might be interested in her new friend, or that he's interested in her, and I'm worrying that at some point she might decide to leave me whilst I'm over here and basically leave me completely devastated. I don't know how to talk about it with her because I think I'll just push her away more. Any advice?  P.s. sorry about the wall of text and thanks for reading it :)",r

The thing is, I told her, I let her know what happened, told her it was a huge mistake and I could never muster myself to do anything like it again.  This controlling manipulative personality seems spot on. I feel like she is definitely prolonging this situation to use to her advantage and gain leverage on the relationship. It's been 4 months since I lied(or told the truth), and we talked about it 2 months ago deeply and agreed to not speak of it ever again if I answered how it happened and why I was with Crazy girl. Yet she has brought it up several times in the past week saying thats all she thinks about. Calling me a sick man whore for making a choice before I ever met her.

c3tklxz,pz8pe,citrussicily,"That's a good place to start: What kind of writing do you enjoy doing? Fiction? Essays?   I would encourage you to start writing whenever you are feeling stuck, or frustrated. Don't worry about editing, and don't worry about what other people might think. Just put words on paper. Doing this will help you become more sure of yourself, for one thing, and it hopefully it will also be enjoyable for you. After awhile, you should be feeling more confident in yourself, which will help you find ways of being happy.   The next step is to share what you write with people. Try breaking it down like this: write 5 things and pick one of them to share. I'm sure you know someone else who has a interest in writing, so hit them up. Take their compliments, don't belittle yourself. Accept their critiques and use them to better yourself. As you get more confident share with more people, post online, go to writing circles, etc.    Developing a passion for an activity is a lot like building a relationship with somebody, it takes practice and patience. It's the first step towards the happy relationship you want, and it will get you out of the Catch-22 your stuck in right now.  I hope this helps",r

Neither of us has really dated anyone else since then—we're still amicable, have casual sex every once in a while, care for each other deeply, et cetera.   Since we broke up (a couple years ago) I've decided I'm an atheist, and have become less emotional, tending toward a realistic, unattached, logical view of the world.   She, on the other hand, is Catholic, believes in things like Karma; one, true love; and fate.   Despite these things, I don't find myself attracted to, or able to care for, anybody except her. At the same time, I don't want to start a relationship (again) that can't last.   Are there any couples out there like this that have found a way to make a relationship, marriage, and parenthood work?",r

It's been 8 years since then, and she says she's never given it to anybody - is it possible to be in a relationship like that? I don't have it, don't want it, but I don't even know the 'real world' risks. She says its really low when she doesn't have a breakout, and they only happen once a year or so.

There's no question that she likes me.  She told me the other day that she'd decided that she never wants to have kids, because she never imagined having kids with the guy she was with.  But after meeting me, that feeling changed.  I'm not sure how much more clear a sign of attraction than saying she wants to have my kids could ever be...  so it's not that she isn't interested.  But she doesn't want to hurt this guy she's been with for years.  I don't want her to either...  But also I want a *real* relationship with her, not sneaking around, not having to always keep it secret.  So I've been pushing too hard, and getting angry and frustrated, and then becoming childishly mad at the situation.

j3m6o,j3m6o,Concerned4Friend,"I met this guy about a year ago at a party and we hit it off.  We live near each other and get lunch and hang out every once in a while.  He's a really nice guy, generous, not ugly, with a variety of interests, a good conversationalist.  The thing is, his live-in girlfriend of 5 years (who I've met at least 15 times) seems to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  She's not particularly attractive (below his level on that point), doesn't seem to contribute anything to conversations, doesn't seem that smart, is bossy, needy, doesn't seem to have any of her own friends, and belittles him in public for no real reason.  They don't seem to really have any common interests, only interests that I'm pretty sure he would have zero interest in doing if it weren't for her.  He never, or very rarely, speaks negatively about her at all, and outwardly seems to be happy with their relationship, which is all I can judge on.  The thing is, given our age (mid 20's) and how long he's been dating her, I suspect that he just doesn't have the inertia to break up with her and find someone way better for him.  I play racquetball with him sometimes at the local YMCA and sometimes he cancels because she's lonely and wants him to go home and entertain her.  Most of the time I see him he asks what I'm up to and if I want to hang out because she's busy with something (essentially, if she's around, she needs him there to hang out, probably because she has no other friends I know of).  I guess the question boils down to this:  my *personal* opinion is that my friend, who I've known for about a year (not life-long and we don't really discuss anything too heavy together) is wasting time with this chick.  I want him to find someone better.  Do I stay out of it?  Risk our friendship by dumping my thoughts on him?  Try to get him to talk about his relationship with me more and ease into a discussion?",r

64vc4w,64vc4w,pixel8edpenguin,"Ohio, USA.   I want to preface this by saying I just started to seek professional help for the problems I'm about to admit to (but it boils down to me being a failure in life due to a stressful upbringing). So here goes a little back story.   I (husband) and my wife have been married 13 years, together 20. We were high school sweethearts with a Catholic upbringing. We waited until we were married to make love. I don't know if that's important, I haven't eaten or gotten much sleep in the last 36 hours. Over the past three to five years my wife and I have emotionally drifted apart. The majority of that is my fault by refusing foot rubs because she wouldn't do things I thought were important (leaving shit out, not going down on me). I'm learning that is a form of punishment... not cool. Haven't had sex since November (I initiated) So many other things but that has nothing to do with legalities.  I have failed in financially providing for my family (she has a career). I've jumped job to job. I had lofty ideas but no drive to follow through or ability to execute. And that got old for her (can't blame her for that).  We have a child, house, and pets.  About a month and a half ago we both agreed to dissolve our marriage. We both wanted out. We agreed to split the saving and checking accounts and I would find a place to live. The following week I swear I had a change inside of me. I cried telling her how much I do love her and how hard I will work. I agreed to get help. She agreed to a month of me showing her how much she means to me. And I have worked my ass of to show her.  So here's where it changes... yesterday I found out she's been fucking another man (for a month and a half). I have the facebook conversation. I got on her phone (the account is under my name) and looked. I had suspicions so it wasn't spur of the moment. We had a blowout where I read it to her. I was (didn't) going to post it on facebook. I told our family. We have been talking things out. I still want to be with her. Us neglecting each other made her change to the point of sucking another mans dick. He's a police officer at the job she got because of me.  I don't necessarily want to do the things I'm going to ask. I need time to calm down and think. But knowing my options will make things easier.  So my questions are: Can a judge force marriage counseling? Am I still entitled to half her retirement? Partial / full custody of child (due to adultery, bad influence)? Child support? Would there be legal repercussions if I post the screen shot on FB? Can I get a restraining order on the cop so he can never be a negative influence on our kid? Can I get him fired? What are my other legal options?  I am open to opinion based advice too. I am so lost.  Edit: Thanks for the insight. I've been thinking about it after a little bit of sleep. I haven't earned the right to take any of her retirement. Plus if we're going to fix us I can't do it with looming threats. We are amazing parents and everything we do needs to be for the benefit of our kid.",l

c3aqr49,nnslz,talashira,"Yes, the world functions in gray zones... but you really ought to have taken an anthropology and/or psychology class during the course of your education, because while you are apparently fully versed in the fuzzy world of morality, you seem to be woefully and even willfully ignorant of human nature in terms of expected reaction to the standards set by one's culture and to the behavior of others within one's own personal universe.  You also seem to have purposively ignored the most basic point of my advice:  &gt; the sooner she's free of you, the sooner she'll get over you and be able to move on.  In none of the scenarios you presented was there an option of staying with her and committing to her 100%, including agreeing to a LDR once she goes abroad. All you have is ""If I continue to screw around on the side, should I tell her?"" Since you're not planning to stay with her in the long run, the sooner you leave her, the sooner she'll get over you and be able to continue with her life. ""Keeping her happy for now"" by withholding information and/or continuing a benefit to her abases her -- it reduces her level that of a child who is not aware enough of the consequences of action and reaction to be able to make a rational decision on her own behalf.  And as for you arguing that ""it's her choice because she's said she wants to stay with me as long as possible until she leaves,"" she doesn't know you're messing around on the side (and yes, willful flirtation and discussions of relations with another woman *is* cheating in our culture), so that initial point is entirely invalid, as telling her in any attempt to ""let her make her own fully-informed decision"" as to whether or not to stay with you will surely only hurt her and cause her to break up with you anyway.  Unless there is a chance -- and a good, somewhat solid chance, at that -- of you deciding to stay with her and really see this all the way through, you need to break up with her immediately. There is no gray area there.  As for telling her, once you've dumped her, that you've been messing around on the side... I'd recommend you don't. You have an obligation to be honest in a monogamous relationship, but if you're ending things with her, then there is no perceivable benefit gained on either end by telling her. (Of course, in her mind, you have an obligation to monogamy, too, and you've clearly thrown that out the window, so I'm not sure how you see that this is a moral question worthy of examination while the question of ""Does this make me a cheating douche?"" is being ignored, but you're clearly a very confused young man, in more ways and on more levels than one.)  I'll reiterate for clarity's sake: Break up with her immediately, and don't tell her what you've been up to.  Since I don't need this to turn into a dissertation, I'm going to end by pointing out to you that you're choosing to address numerous perceived moral questions revolving around and within this scenario while ignoring several others that are inextricably connected. Unless you're going to review and consider all potential scenarios equally and in the same light, this sort of rigmarole is pointless and needlessly confusing for you. Morality may be gray, but her pain is black and white, and what culture has told her her whole life ought to cause her pain is also pretty damn monochromatic. Her reaction is not to be guessed at because it can be assumed by knowing the expectations of her culture; the benefits of each scenario seem also equally clear. In the end, it all boils down to whether your personal compass tells you the same thing as it tells most: to do the least harm and the most lasting good across your life.  Breaking up with her immediately, keeping your mouth shut, and then moving forward on your own and spending some time determining how important both monogamy and honesty are to you so that you don't wind up in a similar situation again does the least harm and the most good; it is, in my humble opinion, the best way to go.  P.S. That whole ""walk a mile in another's shoes"" thing ought to be a suggestion you begin to take as often as is humanly possible, because while you mention that you have considered what total transparency would cause her to feel, you don't seem to have paused to wonder how the situation in reverse, given the same total transparency, would cause *you* to feel. Sympathy is stronger than empathy. Work on it, please.",r

(Among other things he did) They get together and he stops talking to me. No goodbye or a sorry we can't be friends.   Anyways his friend, lets say his name is Dale.

We have been talking about 2 months now and he wants me to visit him in his state but since I work full time and go to school full time. I really can't budge until the summer. Dale has been talking about we should get physical when I get there but he has no job but does have a car. Anyways I wanted to ask him to get serious, because I do like him. However a girl posted on his fb wall not 2 days after I talked to him last. How he was her Romeo and how she spent the whole night talking to him and willing to do it again. Also how she loves him. All while I was at work.   I don't know if I should get mad or show him I don't care and find someone else, just because we aren't official. What should I do?

dx0grv8,8apea6,malachi_23,"Here's the thing. From your perspective it was a little thing. And maybe you're right. But from the perspective of the police, the courts, and the system that deals with fights and domestic violence many times a day, for every couple that has a ""little thing"" that happens once and doesn't escalate there are dozens of couples whose ""little things"" are big things, or escalate, or would have escalated had one of the two people involved not been arrested.  By the time someone calls the cops, the cops show up, and they investigate, it's no longer a ""little thing"" -- resources have been spent because your ""little thing"" was big and loud enough to maybe be a ""big thing."" And as a general rule, if there's evidence that there was violence -- and in this case, both of you admitted it and you had marks on you -- then someone is going to jail. Because there is too high a chance that your ""little thing"" that happened earlier that night will turn into a ""big thing"" later that night, and the cops aren't willing to take that chance.  So your BF -- the one who was identified as the aggressor -- gets taken to jail. He gets bail set because that's his right, and while you would only have to post 10% of it though a bail bond company, it is what it is.   No, it's not likely that you'll get to see him before his court date unless you post his bail. He's sitting in lock up, not in a jail or prison -- while your jurisdiction might be different, the one's I'm familiar with simply aren't set up to allow visitations.   It's highly unlikely, despite what you've seen on TV, that he's going to get the chance to ""spin"" anything. If the court determines he can't afford an attorney, he'll get a public defender; otherwise y'all will have to pay for an attorney or he'll just have to speak on his own behalf. But this isn't a complex crime where he's going to get interrogated any more than he already has, nor are they going to offer him a ""plea bargain"" if he ""gives you up"" -- if they had wanted to, they could have arrested and charged you that night the same they did him. The reason they didn't is because from the cop's perspective they didn't have to -- first, because it was clear to them that he was the primary aggressor/problem, and second because, as I said before, their main goal was to separate you two for a few nights and put the fear of god into both of you. Their hope is that after this, you two will be smart enough to keep your emotions in check and not get into physical altercations over ""little things.""  Yes, there's a good chance that all of this will be dropped once he gets to court -- with a stern warning from the judge, I imagine.   The most critical ""legal advice"" you and your BF are going to get is going-forward advice: it may seem funny and harmless to engage in the same kind of slap-fights popularized in popular media, but in the real world, it's not. If you guys can't maintain a relationship with each other without engaging in criminal levels of drama, it's time to reevaluate your relationship.",l

kkr3u,kkr3u,notafoolnotanasshole,"So my GF knows this guy who keeps inviting her out to seemingly legitimate functions: group events, runs and bike rides, and races and stuff. But I get pretty strong vibes that he's looking for a little more from her. I know there's a strong attraction between the two, and generally speaking - there's nothing wrong with that. Lots of people on earth, some are going to be attracted to each other. Doesn't mean anything. Even the flirting they do is fine by me, at least the logical part of my brain says so.   The problem is that I keep finding myself in situations where I either have to worry about why she's going with him, or I have to be the asshole controlling boyfriend and let her know I'm not comfortable with her going - thus preventing her from having a supposedly legitimate friend.   I'm tired of being in that lose/lose spot and I think maybe I should just break up with her and let her go be friends with whomever she wants.  Maybe I just can't trust her, and I'm chickening out and pushing her away before she has a chance to hurt me. Maybe it's a big mistake and a cowardly way to act.  Or maybe I should man-up and learn to trust her and if she ever does cheat deal with it then.   But every time I go crazy. So even though there's no evidence of cheating, I still think maybe I should dump her because I'm sick of always wondering....Crazy?  Or maybe I deserve to be with someone who doesn't continually put me in lose/lose situations. Surely there has to be out there who will want to date me without requiring that I share her with this asshole.

We started talking and it turns out we have a lot in common; we both share the same heritage, we have a similar taste in music, we both like the same TV shows and comedy. We got off at the same stop and spent about and hour just talking before I walked her to her friend's house.   I'm not exactly forever alone though I often have a hard time talking to girls, but with her conversation flows naturally. She seems a lot more mature than a lot of girls I know and I can actually talk about stuff I'm interested in like world affairs and politics without boring her socks off. We've since been chatting online and developing feelings for each other, and we agreed to meet this Saturday for coffee but last night she dropped a bombshell - She's 15, and I'm 21. It came as a surprise to both of us; she thought I was around 16 cos I look really young, and I thought she was at least 18.    I don't know what to do. I really don't want to cut her out of my life because she's such a cool person to know, but it feels weird and creepy talking to 15 year old girls.

km1d7,km1d7,,"I'll try to make this as short as possible.  Background: Got engaged to a girl I met on facebook. I've still yet to meet her and yesterday was our 4 months. Reasons I haven't met her yet are due to a horrible stoke of bad luck with her life thus far. Such as the following:  * day after we got together her uncle, aunt, and cousin died in a tornado states away. She went to the funerals and was there about a month  * Came home to her house randsacked by her ex's brother (at least that's what he claims) spent the next day at the police station, and cleaning.  * about 2 months before we started talking she got ran into a guard rail by a semi who was asleep at the wheel. Broke her rib(s), and fractured her arm.   * Got a phone call that night about her dad that just had his second stroke. She went back down to the state they live in.   * Spent 2 weeks there visiting her dad in the hospital, until he passed away. She went down hill from depression due to it.   * She's spent the past month and a half at least there since  I've spent the past months being there for her emotionally as much as I could being states away. I also can't drive due to losing my license so I can't make the trip. She has been ignoring me for the past 2 weeks. Won't say she loves me back, wont return calls or texts. Nothing.

I ask her out and she says yes and we are having a grand ol' time, but she keeps saying things like ""I can't give myself fully to you"" and I find out its because her ex is manipulating her by saying he'll kill himself if she cuts off contact with him (her first love).  This girl says things such as ""I feel extremely comfortable around you"" and ""I love kissing you"" etc etc.  But she also claims to have ""no time to see me"" but conveniently seems to always have time to hang out with her best friend, lets call him Jon.

m2jvr,m2jvr,onemorethrow,"This is something that happened several months ago, but I thought about it today, and I'm worried about what to do if I get into this situation again.   My girlfriend and I had recently graduated from college, and we were planning to live together in the fall. I was taking her home from a bar where she'd been having a girls' night out with her friends. She was pretty drunk, and seemed a bit emotional. Just as I stop the car in front of her place, she turns to me and says, ***""Do you think I look thin?""***  Now, I have to admit my girlfriend is not the skinniest girl in the world. She's a bit overweight, but she's not obese. I think she's extremely beautiful the way she is. Nonetheless, she is very insecure about her weight.  I was completely dumbfounded by this question. I've gotten ""Do you think I look fat?"" before, and my standard answer is, ""Absolutely not, you look beautiful."" And she always does look beautiful. But I had no idea how to approach this inverted question. So, being the idiot that I am, I blurted out, ""Honestly, baby, you're not the thinnest, but you're not fat.""  Cue the immediate meltdown. She was crying and yelling at me. She somehow managed to twist what I said into, ""I don't love you."" It took a while to get her calmed down, but I finally managed to tell her, ""Baby, if I didn't find you beautiful and amazing, why would I want to be with you?"" She took this in, and smiled weakly, quietly nodded her head.  I asked a couple of my friends about the situation later, and they didn't have any idea what the appropriate response would have been to that question. They said it was a no-win situation, a complete snare. I'm hoping R_A will know something different.

To my knowledge, no.  But again, this is why you get an attorney.  And considering you're going into a business that is still actively illegal at the Federal level, I'd say it's $1,500 well spent.    But you can often have a board with as few as 2 people, or have board members be ""outsiders"" who don't otherwise work for the business.

om0ui,om0ui,,"I'm a male university student, 18, and the woman is a high school senior, 17, and we've known each other since November 22nd, 2011. At the beginning of my winter break, we started flirting. The first friday night of winter break, I was high on bud and xanax, and she was drunk. I ended up laying down some moves, and we made out for most of the night. I did this with the intention of trying to have sex with her, and only that. I normally NEVER do this, and wouldn't have dreamed of ever being with this girl. She's very attractive.   We didn't do so, but continued hanging out. She was semi-flirtatious with others, but as far as I know she didn't do anything with anyone else over winter break. Well, things developed pretty normally up until this previous weekend; kissing and cuddling with each other any nights we were around each other. Sunday night, my last day in town before leaving for university, I invited her over to my house, and cooked her supper, as well as another 'couple.' We ended up doing the deed, but I think she did it to try to get me to stay around her. We didn't really get to know each other as well as most girls I have had feelings for. This was the first time I've had sex with a girl without meeting her parents first. I know what kind of person she is, and she's someone I'd like to date, but I don't know what she wants.   This weekend, I'm going back to my home town to see her. I invited her on a date on the night of her winter dance, mostly to see if she liked me enough to miss it. She was ecstatic, and we're going out this Saturday. Like I said, I've never really been in a physically based relationship before, and need some guidance.   Is it normal to have feelings, beyond physical, for her under the circumstances?   How should I express them?  What things should I avoid doing?

There was a cheating episode and I'm trying to fix it by cutting out the ex completely (it's what my girlfriend wants too. We decided to work through it and it's more than I deserve. I know.), but she refuses to go.  I've moved halfway across the country (for college), changed my number three different times, blocked her facebook (and countless friends of hers who let her message me from theirs), her (many) emails, blocked her phone number and four of her friends numbers who she calls/texts me from (Verizon only lets you block 5 online and I rotate them to keep her out of contact).  I realize that cheating on my now girlfriend lets my ex think that she still has a chance, but I just want her out of my life completely. It was a gigantic mistake, but I can't change the fact that it happened. We have such a long and ugly back and forth history that I don't think I can get a restraining order (and I'm not even sure how those work when you live in separate states). My own mother (who has professional experience in fields similar to this) says that I probably can't get one because I can never prove that I consistently avoid contact and want nothing to do with this girl.  I don't know what else to do. She can text my email and she'll insult me to the point of retaliating, then turn things around saying that I give her hope by contacting her.  Recently, after she tried talking to my girlfriend on facebook (the night of her almost-suicide-cocaine-related-fiasco), I told her that I'm saving her email-texts to build up a record to try and get a restraining order. She cleaned up her act a lot and is careful to always sound polite, but she is STILL TALKING TO ME.  I have beat this into the ground; made it painfully clear that I want nothing to do with her. I ignored her for months on end and she still emails me. I had them filtered to the trash, but my girlfriend will look through my email and see them and get upset.

797a1z,797a1z,sassy-gal,I recently tried to ship my vehicle. from Ontario to BC. The company I hired contracted a shipping company. My car was over 3 weeks late. I was never given photos of my car after requesting a photo for weeks. First I was told the truck was hit by a deer and was going in for repairs. Then I was told it was abandoned in a different province. I contacted the police because I thought my car was stolen. I also contacted my bank. The company then cancelled my shipment after 3 weeks. When my vehicle was picked up the shipping lot manager said it never left the lot. Neither company is willing to compensate me. I was lied to about the location of my vehicle and it's arrival date. I had to rent a car which set me back over 2 grand. Plus I was without my vehicle for over a month. I had all of my personal belongings in the car as well.

He sits at home on reddit most days and has a few hobbies that keep him busy.  We also live 30 minutes apart from one another.   I don't get to see him too often... Anyway, I think about him all the time. So I text him, make plans with  him, set aside most my time off to spend with him. He makes close to no effort to spend time with me. And absolutely NO effort to get to know my friends  If he comes to my house in the evenings (I get off at 9), he never wants to go out and instantly falls asleep. Then tells me, before I get in bed, he's leaving early in the morning (I usually don't work til 1 or 2 in the afternoon).  If I go to his house, we watch a movie or something, and he falls asleep right away. We only have sex once or twice a week. If I don't text him first, he barely makes any contact with me during the day.   He is really great to me, picks me up from work, makes me breakfast, etc.   When I do talk to him about making more of an effort or spending more time with me, he just says I'm being dramatic and thinks I'm trying to pick a fight.  He rarely shows much affection towards me and we only really hang out if I make an effort, or if I go to his side of town.   SO I'm at a loss.

ku6jd,ku6jd,sourmash123,"Me: 23, Him: 28. Married 3 years, dated for 2. Pregnant with first child.   I have always been the affectionate one, and that has always been okay with us. He doesn't really ever touch me outside of sexual situations, but I touch him constantly. I lean on him, play with his hair, rub his back (which he returns if I ask), kiss him, etc. Again, I haven't ever really noticed or cared before. I make cuddles happen and I ask for the occasional massage, etc. We love each other and that comes through in many other ways.   Since I became pregnant, I have developed a strong need to be touched, hugged, held, rubbed, etc. I tell him each day I'm in need of affection, and he tries to oblige, but he's just not good at it. I will say something like, ""I would love some affection right now"", and he will rub my arm three times and then smile and look proud of himself. Last night I said, ""I am just wondering if you could try to make it a habit to be more affectionate because I'm just craving it these days"" and he said ""Of coarse!"" and then did the arm rub thing again. I am going nuts! I need to be touched so badly that I can barely stand it and I think I'm becoming depressed over it.  I am afraid that if I don't approach this correctly, he will touch me more but only out of obligation, and he will view it as a chore, and it will be unpleasant for both of us.

s1e83,s1e83,,"How can I even begin to describe what is going on inside of me right now?  I have never been very active in the world of relationships. I have always been hesitant to make a move or to reveal my interest in a woman. This hesitation existed back into the days of highschool, if not even longer. I haven't been completely isolated though. I have had girlfriends and flings. I used to be very social, just not willing to risk getting hurt. I suppose that you could say that I have been over-protective of my emotions for my whole life.  About 10 years ago, I started dating a woman, Jessica, that I liked very much. At this point in time, I want to say that I only thought that I loved her, but I'm not really sure if I even know what that word means. I dated her for almost a year and that was the longest relationship that I have ever been in. We had a lot of fun together. We had great sex. Everything was wonderful. We started to have dificulties in our relationship and eventually broke up. Then we began that phase of being broken up then sleeping together and getting back together then fighting and breaking up again. The nail that sealed the coffin was when she slept with my best friend. He confessed this to me and I knew that I could never trust her again.   That last relationship ended over 8 years ago and I have been single ever since. I have been more than single. I have made myself unavailable. I have been completely detached from my emotions and have been unwilling to allow myself to get hurt again. I was very hurt. I did love her and she hurt me in the worst way that I could imagine. In the past 8 years, I have had sex one time in a completely random affair with a woman that I will never see again. It would be more than accurate to say that I have closed my heart up and not let it out in an way. I have been interested in other women, but I haven't been willing to attempt anything with them. I think that I felt so hurt by Jessica that I couldn't imagine facing that kind of pain again.  This past weekend, I had a very emotionally close connection with a woman that I have held in high regard for many years. She has been a close friend of my sister since they were in grade school and I have always liked her. She was married for many years and has recently left her husband. I saw her for the first time in at least 10 years over St. Patrick's day. I was dumbstruck and couldn't keep myself away from her. I wasn't agressive in any way. Much the opposite, we merely walked together and talked and enjoyed each other's company. I could see interest in her eyes. She was looking at me in a way that I haven't seen a woman look at me in years. More accurately, I haven't seen a woman look at me that way in all of my life or at least I haven't recognized it.   This past month and a half has been an extremely trying time for me. I quit a 20 year pack-a-day smoking addiction. I quit a 10 year daily marijuana habit. I quit those two things in anticipation of a major and incredibly painful surgery to my shoulder with a very long and painful recovery period. The surgery was my first and was on my dominant arm, so I have had to re-learn how to do nearly everything: brushing my teeth, dressing myself, eating, sleeping, etc. I have had to become incredibly dependant on others where I was fiercely independant before. My arm has been in a sling for over a month so far and will be for at least 6 more weeks. It would be a major understatement to say that this hasn't been a very trying time for me.   This past weekend, my family and I went out of town and my sister brought her friend, Laurie, along because she needed a vacation from her own problems. We were together for 3 days. We were all together enjoying the beautiful weather at the beach, drinking, and having fun. As you can probably guess, Laurie and I finally connected on Saturday night. I let my guard down for the first time in 8 years and let another woman in. She was wonderful. I was open about my history and she expressed her desire to not hurt me. We both realized that the other was in a delicate and sensitive situation. We went from keeping our distance and admiring each other silently from afar to sleeping together in less than two hours.  Now the weekend has ended. I have returned to my home and life. Laurie has returned to her home and life. I have no idea what I am feeling. I didn't know that I could even feel the way that I so. I am an emotional wreck. I feel like 8 years of repressed emotion is escaping my body all at once. I had to leave work because I couldn't control myself. I have come home and been crying heavily for over an hour. I am so lost. I have no idea what to do. I have no idea what to think. This is so painful. I hurt so badly. My shoulder hurts and my heart hurts and I am defenseless to both. I have opened the floodgates and my emotions are flowing without restriction and I can't slow them.   I'm not really sure what advice I want. I really just wanted to let all of this out and I have nobody else to talk to. I feel so exposed and don't want anyone to see me so weak and without control.   TL;DR: I have been emotionally disconnected for eight years following a bad breakup and just slept with one of my sister's best friends, who just left her husband late in 2011. I now can't control all the emotions that I have repressed for years.",r

There's a smaller issue of her also hanging out with another of her roommate's friends, an ex-boyfriend. She says they are just friends and I believe that, as they are on opposite spectrums religiously and and politically, but I guess that bothers me a little bit, as due to his and the roommate's friendship, he sees her more often than me.

40letn,40letn,Dslay20,"Afternoon Reddit! I really need some legal advice on this situation I'm in with one of my roommates. I go to college In Dallas Texas.  Over this Christmas break my roommate broke into my room, stole my keys and repeatedly used my car. He also caused thousands of dollars of damage to it. When I got back a few days ago I noticed the damages and confronted him. He lied and said he had no idea how it happened and that he never used my car. He left 5 recipts in my car (with his signature) and when I confronted him he admitted his guilt. I told him to email me his admittion of guilt and told him I wanted to not get the police involved. Today his parents refused to cover all the damages my roommate caused. I have undeniable pro he stole my car on multiple occasions and a written confession.  Is what my roommate did a felony? What is the best legal action to ensure I get the money he caused in damages?  Thanks Reddit  Edit 1:  thanks for all of the advice everyone. One thing I have to point out is I have no time to spend in court. I have a huge course load. How long (on estimate) would small claims court take? Also his family is super richer and would definitely hire him a lawyer. I feel like this would make my chances of winning very small.   Edit 2: Thanks so much everyone for your advice. I settled this afternoon with him. Part of the settlement is that I can't discuss is outside of my family but I took your advice and made sure I am covered from damages/crimes he may have committed over the period of taking my car.   This leads me to another question for you great people. The same roommate who stole my car caused a fire over break that ruined the house and caused 40,000 worth of damages. He has verbally committed to paying the damages and says that his parents are dealing with the landlord. I live with 5 people in total, and me and the other three roommates want to kick this guy out. We see a number of problems with this though.  1) We do not have it in writing that my roommate who caused the fire and stole my car (lets call him Bob) will pay the 40,000 in damages. If we kick him out is anything stopping him from walking away and causing us to pay? Is there any good way to avoid this liability? 2) Is there any legal argument I can make to my landlord to get my commitment broken early? Something along the lines of not feeling safe/Bob has been stealing my stuff? 3) Any other general ideas/tips to try to get out of this house ASAP would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much everyone.",l

It can't get any worse from this point really. I don't know the living situation or anything like that but it's possible to fix anything with enough dedication and compassion.

I approach Employer B and offer to work 30 hours per week for a wage of $0.01 per hour as a ""permanent consultant."" But I can't actually work 30 hours for them since I have my other job, so I just put in X amount of time, which would be somewhat equivalent in actual pay to the cost the company for the benefits I receive for working the 30 hours? Would this work? Is it illegal? It is certainly a violation of the  minimum wage laws, but we could amend my wage to reflect $8 per hour or something to satisfy that, and they just not issue me a check... since I'm getting ""paid"" in benefits? &gt;  &gt; TL;DR. Purely hypothetical. Can a company legally pay me in only benefits, if I agree not to receive wages?

d9zn8yr,5cv4mi,Eeech,"It's important to remember that employers don't have to have reasons to fire employees. Only two states protect medical users, but no laws exist to protect recreational users.    Employers are free to dismiss employees who drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, buy season tickets to the Mets, or drive Audis. Drug testing and dismissal can have extra rules where employers who participate, voluntarily, in programs that give those who test positive a ""second chance"" - they generally get 30 days off unpaid to attend inpatient rehab and continued drug testing.    Since THC is not generally considered a medical addiction, health insurers rarely pay for rehabilitation nor detox  (there are no medical withdrawals defined by the AMA to treat like there are with, say, opiates) - it pretty much rarely qualifies for an even more rare program. If your employer routinely does drug tests, they almost certainly don't participate in any of these programs.    Note, it will still be legal to fire people for recreational THC use, even if made federally legal unless a state passes a law against it.... which is not something I'd consider likely for us to see over the next 25 years or more, optimistically.

We love each other a lot. I know that I might have my future wife in my hands right now.  The only problem is that I AM TOO JEALOUS. For no reason, really.

Also, I felt powerless of the fact that I wasn't there to be her ""prom night date"", and she will forever remember that dude for that...  * Few days ago I tried to ""dig my own grave"" by asking her how many people she slept with/had relationship. The number was normal (3 long relationships and other 2 smaller ones) but I still felt like shit for it. Again, i totally understand that she had a life before me, but this still saddens me way too much  * For S. Valentine I got her a new computer, and I'm now in the process of transferring all the data from the old to the new one. And, of course, I have to transfer pictures.. I found (because I look for them..) two picts where she was kissing two of her bfs in 2008.. And now i'm sad again..  She doesn't speak with any of those guys and I have NO REASON at all to doubt her.

They declined.  Anywho, I was stood up for about a month (repeatedly, the girls would cancel last minute with a big apology or a ""rain check,"" and then just disappear off the face of the planet) until I finally landed a date because it turns out that we have a mutual friend in common on facebook.

26t81a,26t81a,weguccison,"Hey R/legaladvice!  I want to claim abandoned property that has been sitting on our property for almost 7 months now. The property is a ""toy vending machine"" , you know the ones where you put 50 cents and recieve a cheap toy. Originally the owner of the machine would come in every month and maintain/refill the machine. The owner then sold his toy machine business to another individual ( the owner of the machine more than likely has dozens of these machines). While in short, the new owner of the machine has not maintained or refilled it in over 6 months! It used to be done every month on a schedule like fashion.   So my questions are this:  1) How do I legally take ownership of this machine so I can continue to use it? To add some detail, a contract between the owner of the machine and the property it is on is non-existent. We have no contact information of the NEW owner to see what is going on as we have only met him twice; 1 being an introduction and the other when he came to take the money generated; but did not refill the machine with new items to sell like the previous owner would do.  2) what type of abandonment does this fall under? Since there is *some* money involved (not much however +/- 200$).   So in all what can we do? Its very ambiguous to where the line is here. There is no contract existing since the beginning of the enterprise 5-6 years ago when we first started, let alone after the new owner took over the machine. There is also no contact information to get in touch with the new owner to understand what is happening with him and the machine on our property.  This is in New Mexico by the way.",l

My ex has photos of his ex girlfriend naked on his phone, and had an entire folder on his laptop full of girls we went to high school with who were also naked and in different positions that I found. I stayed with him because he promised he would change, trust me from experience, he won't change. He obviously doesn't care about your feelings or how you would feel about the situation. When my ex and I broke up he not only left me for a girl we worked with who he lied to my face about where he was and had been seeing her behind my back without my knowledge, but he also tried to sleep with some of my friends.

So my ex boyfriend emailed me a few days after thanksgiving, wishing my family and I happy holidays and whatnot. At first, his intention was to make amends since we ended off on an extremely bad note back in September, but continued to tell me how he thinks about me and misses me and has regrets. So much more was said, how he was still in love with me and all this crap.  FYI; we talked about marriage the last few weeks before we broke up. He is 29 and I am 22.    One problem though: he has a girlfriend. He actually started dating her like a week or two after we broke up (how do you even do that?). He told me he is in love with her and in love with me, and is extremely confused and needs to make the ""right"" decision on what he wants.   What do I do in this situation? So far, I've told him he needs to make a decision fairly quickly because I don't want to waste my time on a dead end. I do still love him and care for him and I am starting to get hurt and just irritated at his confusion and indecisiveness. He told me he wanted to be with me again but then goes off and says he doesn't know.   So, reddit, what do?",r

c1a1le0,eq5ae,knighter50,"(This is on my phone, so sorry for any formatting issues.)  Okay,  This should be easy if you practice some self-control. Don't give into that urge to try and contact her again! She knows you tried to and is voluntarily not responding. I empathize with your stance, but unfortunately, even if you're not desperate, it can come off that way if you push further. Most people naturally like to feel in control and accomplished. So, it's always good to provide people with at least a TEENY bit of challenge, as to make them feel like they're making their own decisions-- not ""giving in"" to someone else's.   May I ask around what age each of you are, and how much younger/older she is? Because she seems a bit immature (HS/early college), where instead of OPENLY COMMUNICATING her stance or feelings (the most important thing before and during dating, mind you) she completely clams up. You need to address that particular issue (not communicating) inadvertently in order to get rid of confusion on both ends.   You seemed to have handled things pretty well the first confrontation you described: You waited until you finally saw her in person, still acted friendly (albeit drunk), and lightly teased her about what had happened like it wasn't THAT big of a deal.    You want to do the same thing, but tweak it more in your favor.  Step 1: Hell yes you're going to that damn party! DO NOT let this situation affect what you would NORMALLY do with your friends the slightest bit. Do your best to go about life just as you would otherwise.   [Most Important] Step 2: Embody a confidence in how your life IS, THEN what you want. I.E. ""My life is absolutely awesome, but dating her would definitely be a plus."" Realize that i say ""embody""; you need to ACT like this. I'm not telling you to be a cocky, careless asshole-- there's nothing wrong with expressing that someone's opinion matters to you. But it needs to always be clear that you're happy with life as is, and that you don't NEED to date her. It'd just be pretty awesome if you did.   Step 3: WAIT until you see her in person, or until she contacts you (all the while embodying Step 2). Be friendly and genuinely happy to see her as you would be, but don't pretend that she never blew you off. Address the issue casually, like you care but it's FAR from a big deal to you. Make it clear to her that there's no reason that she can't openly communicate with/trust you. I.E. ""Haha, I promise, it's no big deal. We're friends, though. You can be open with me."" and ""I just thought you were pretty awesome and that we'd have a good time on a date. It's no biggie. Just don't leave me on the dust, haha. We all good?"" and ""Don't be afraid to tell me if you ever change your mind :p"" You have the idea. It sounds like you're comfortable enough with her to do this, and THE LESS AWKWARD YOU ACT, THE LESS AWKWARD SHE'LL FEEL.  Consequently, for a moment she feels cornered, then is quickly overcome with ease as she realizes the whole thing isn't as much of a drama-fest as she made it out to be in her head: ""Oh crap, there's no avoiding the subject now! It HAS been unfair of me leaving him in the dust. Oh, he's cool about it. I guess I might as well be honest."" Then neither of y'all are unsure of where things are, and she doesn't feel as much tension because you were so casual. Additionally, you'll likely take a shortcut through the whole ""trust-barrier"" crap that people always claim to have and instantly feel closer to her.   Final notes: Don't be afraid to approach her and say hello. She's more likely to avoid you out of embarrassment. If she STILL acts awkward after all of that, she's either immature emotionally or a lot of what you wrote was positively biased and deceiving. If so, not worth your time IMHO. Good luck!

fp7bm,fp7bm,,"I've been seeing my significant other for the last 6 months now, and I have never connected with somebody in such a profound way in such a short amount of time. We have everything in common (especially a love for gaming), and have the most amazing sex life yadayada, but the last two weeks have been such a downer.  She's been pretty indifferent towards me for the last two weeks, especially on Monday (which of course had to coincide with V Day, but it's our usual night at her place anywya) We both decided to not do anything special, commercial sell-outs we aren't etc., but I still made an effort like I always do, cooked her food and made plenty of cups of tea, the little things. She proceeded to call tiredness on the night, I said okay but she sat up texting her friends and checking that awful social networking site whilst I sat their like a twat. I called her on it and she brushed it aside like she has done before on lesser occasions, but got pissy with me. We resumed like nothing had happened the next day, back to the awesome relationship.  I brought up this up again last night when we met up for a gig last night, her lack of caring about keeping to times when its really necessary, and generally being indifferent and not making the effort to call, which didn't go down well. When we got in from the gig, she told me to 'stop taking this relationship so seriously', and then just carried on like nothing happened. I suggested a week apart to give each other some room to breathe, then she dropped the bombshell that maybe we'd work out better as friends as I was walking out of her door. I told her that we would talk about this after the week apart, and she said she doesn't want to stop talking to me completely for the week, but wants to see how this goes. I told her there and then that friends can't work for me.  I am at a loss because I don't want to lose this girl, but I cannot keep her as a friend because it has never worked out before for me, and I personally cannot be friends with somebody who tells me they love me and has already planned so much for the moths ahead for us two (including her actually buying gig tickets, making enquiries about holidays etc.).

Sometimes it would come back to the way he was but he would realize it. Everyday my relationship has gotten stronger because I showed him how much I love him, that I believed and trusted he would change. Talking is the key, not blaming just one person, I'm sure your not perfect either, you both just need to talk it out and really work this out for the both of you. Good luck!",r

ia3ge,ia3ge,,"LDR for most of 9 years, known each other for the last 14 years. Me: upper 30s; she: lower 30s. We visited each other whenever possible, on average 5-6 weeks/year. Once she spent almost three consecutive months with me, went fine.  I was never attracted by the idea of living over there, and she has known this from the start; however she wasn't very keen on moving here either; she has a lot of family back home, while I have very little left.  Up and downs, but feelings remained. Communication worsened a bit as we got busier. I can be sensitive at times, especially when lonely or with a certain kind of humour which she likes. Once I felt quite hurt by her joke and I felt so distressed that I ignored her for almost 24 hours (she was with me at the time). That hurt her a lot. Eventually I realized my mistake, apologized, she accepted.  After much consideration, eventually she moved here with me. She left her job, said goodbye to friends and family and arrived mid May. First few days she had nausea, every morning until after noon. Medicines didn't help. Blood test OK. Not pregnant. Unfortunately I was swamped with work (deadlines approaching, couldn't delegate) and I couldn't stay home all day.  Things improved, until first week of june, when she announced that she thought it over and she wanted to go back home, effectively ending the relationship. She said that she felt herself thinking ""this is it, this is what my life is going to be"" and she felt a sudden, unexpected rejection. So she decided to consider leaving, keeping it to herself at first, only announcing it to others once she felt confident that she was OK with it.  Her rationalization for rejection: 1- her unease at being far from family; 2- my unwillingness to move there; 3- my sensitivity, which - she says - would make her feel worried of inadvertently hurting me, which would make me distressed.  I was shocked, devastated, upset that she didn't tell me all of this earlier, so that we could try something before her decision would solidify. During her stay, at times I had had the distinct impression that she was troubled, but I accounted that to home sickness, or adjustment. I had no idea.  She stayed one more week, making arrangements to send her stuff back. We had a few heartfelt conversations, me talking, but she listened; I offered to make my best effort to try and change whatever was bothering her. I even offered to come and live wherever she wanted. I understood that it really didn't matter to me as long as I could stay with her - a revelation of my own, grown out of the most intense pain I had ever felt. I tried to talk her into at least going back to a LDR for a while until I could get my things together and move. She said that she didn't know anymore; she'd think about it but could make no promises. She said that she still loved me a lot, but she had lost hope.  Now she's visiting relatives abroad, not yet home; no communication to me. First few days I sent her a message per day, officially to recap my day; deep down I wanted to keep a channel open, for fear that without it, she'd forget me more easily. Friend of mine helped me realize that I should better leave her alone, rather keep a diary - possibly sending it to her later; so I told her that and I stopped e-mails. But her silence hurts; makes me anxious, afraid. One night I saw her online; I broke down, I IM'ed her (breaking a promise) and asked her if she was OK, if she got my messages; she said yes, but she wasn't sure if she would reply. She was trying to keep the conversation short, as I feared but wasn't hoping for. I ended up telling her how devastated I still felt and how much I still loved her. She said that she was sorry about that; she didn't say ""I love you"" back, something she had said a few times at the airport before our goodbye. I had the impression that she was trying hard to control her emotions, and this really pained me, as, at that moment, I wanted to know them and I was very emotional myself. We said good night and I cried myself to sleep.  She's going back home in a few days; before leaving she told me she'd probably want to talk only after she's home. I think she wants to be with her family to have more support. I made her promise that she at least will call me and tell me her final decision by phone, as it would be too painful for me to receive such news by e-mail.  I feel she is focusing on the problems, which were after all infrequent, and which have almost always stemmed out of the uncertainty of a LDR that you're not sure will ever turn ""normal""; maybe not giving enough thought to the great times we had, what we built, what we came to accept and like in each other. We have very similar tastes in many important things (lifestyle, ethics, politics). We are not the best ever match, but we often agreed we were a great match.  I think she fears that my effort to change will fail (I changed myself a couple times for the relationship's sake, so I disagree). She said that she has to think to her own happiness; I do not object (of course) but it pains me that I might not be part of that any longer, as this is what I have been working for so long.  I feel that I am too old to start again; that I probably will never reach the same intimacy with someone else. Right now, I am not sure I even want someone else. Maybe in part it's just habit, or reluctance to change, but still I feel this is not what was supposed to happen, what we deserved. I feel that something is being yanked out of me and I want it back, because I know I can make it work; it shouldn't die like this.  * * *  Thank you for reading and for your thoughts.  S.",r

The law can help you enforce contracts and recover damages when contracts are broken, but suing is no substitute for doing business with trustworthy and reliable partners.

5amf11,5amf11,NillaPuddn,"My roommate and I moved into a 2-person apartment in SC. Under the lease we are both responsible for the full amount monthly (i.e. if one person does not pay, the other can be held liable). I was fairly up-front about leaving early for orders, and offered (verbally) to find a replacement or pay the remaining three month's rent after leaving for active duty.  Following SCRA, I gave prior notice two months in advance (the requirment is 30 days; had to fulfill the manager's two month early policy for two ), furnished orders, got everything documented.

19e188,19e188,,"I'm quite lost, here. I met my SO online a year and a half ago. We're now living together and are very much in love. She's recovering from severe depression, and is very insecure about herself, which makes her really jealous.  We've been having a recurring fight about two of my female friends. One I met on the same dating website as her, but never thought of being with for various reasons. We're both in commited relationships, and we just generally share our passion for playing the violin. The other is a friend of six years, who I once had a crush on, when I first met her. The feeling was never reciprocated, and they're long gone for me. There never was any ambiguous situation, and she's been a great friend for years.  My SO wants me to stop having any contact with them. For the first one, she can't stand that I met her on a dating site, the same I met my SO on. As for the second, she sees her as an ex of mine.  I tried talking to her, to know what exactly made her uncomfortable. Is it an issue of trust ? Of her feeling left out ? A fear that I might leave her ? Her answers always come down to this: ""you met this one on a dating site. You had a crush on the other one."" without further explanation, as she considers those reasons to be self-sufficient.   As for me, though I think in can understand what bothers her, I still think it is never ok to forbid your SO to see someone. I'm doing everything I can to show that I love her, and that I would never cheat on her. I know that making a relationship last requires sacrifices, but I'm also afraid she won't stop there, and no matter what or who, she will always have a problem with me having female friends.   I really want to make this work, but I'm afraid this problem will never be over... Am I doing this completely wrong ? What should I do ? =(  Edit: I'm 23M,my SO is 21F",r
1a2xph,1a2xph,,"So I have this situation where my boyfriend and I tend to drink together on occasion for social gatherings- which when we began dating was never an issue. However, recently, a certain problem has arisen.   He likes to grope and/or get physically close to other women when he's drunk.   When we began dating just over 5 months ago, this was never an issue. We drank together and he got drunken crazy over me. But the last few times we have drank together, he's begun acting strangely. The first time I caught him was when he was grabbing my drunk friends breast (which he later claimed to just be helping her in her drunken stupor). The second time there was no excuse- he was literally standing right in front of me and grabbed yet another one of my friends on her ass and shook it firmly. The third and most recent time, I sat there and watched as another women half-sat on him and batted her eyelashes at him on an empty couch after he had taken her seat when she went to the bathroom. Neither of them moved for a good half hour and were pressed very closely together making me very uncomfortable.   Now, the first incident I dismissed as gave him the benefit of the doubt in being drunk and supposedly helping a friend out. The second time I confronted him telling him it made me uncomfortable and that I didn't like it but he didn't really address the issue. The third time he told me it wasn't as bad as I was making it out to be which brings me to now. Am I overreacting? Or is it reasonable to be upset? Has anyone had a similar problem?  Side note: around the second incident he told me that he cheated on his ex 3 times (his ex of 2.5 years) all when he was drunk which makes me all the more skittish.   Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for reading     Pic: my boyfriend and I hungover as hell",r

So advice: encourage her to get out and do more, do stuff on your own so she feels like you're not co-dependent, openly relish in your new found freedoms from each other, wait for things to return to normal.  plan b: she thinks it's your fault, this is the start of everything wrong with her being your fault. bail out bro.",r

However, about 4 months ago, some other guy kissed her (we both went to different schools and the guy was from her school). I told her I could forgive her (because I love her) as long as she still loved me. She said she did. However, about a week or so after this incident, she suggested we took a break until summer (2 months away at this point in time) saying it would be good for both of us to see other people in the meantime. I had my heart set on her though and would not let her go. We finally agreed to her plan, but two days after the start, we got back together. We've had our ups and downs since, but generally things have leveled out. We are now both going to the same school (i transferred for academic reasons) and she keeps on saying how weird it is that we're at the same school.

Instead of my interest in him fizzling out as most relationships do (I think), I'm still just as into him as I was when we first met. He tells me he feels the same.  He's about twelve hours away and it's really hard to meet up so we text and Skype. I work all day and he goes to school for a few hours a day, however, my job is not demanding at all so I have a lot of time to kill. He doesn't do much once he's out since he doesn't have a job so I like to text a lot. He came to visit recently but when he got home he told me he wants some space and to talk less. I'm not thrilled about this, but it's understandable. The only objection I have to this is that I like to know when he gets into sketchy business 1. because it's usually something that upsets me and 2. I end up getting pulled into it somehow. He's usually clingy in a cute way, but when he tells me he needs space I end up texting him more then I usually do/want/intend to. I have no problem doing my own thing when he doesn't ask me to, but as soon as he does I get super clingy.  I'm so flustered I can barely get my thoughts out. I don't want to damage this relationship by doing something I normally don't do.   tl;dr - What do I do to stop clinging to my boyfriend while he's so far away?",r

jy850,jy850,,"First of all, I know that what I did was wrong. I am aware that I already don't trust him, and the relationship was over. At the time, and still, it feels to me like an act of survival. I have been depressed, paranoid, insecure, borderline suicidal, and alienating my friends for the past year. Why? Because I was convinced that there was something very, very wrong with me. However, I'm pretty sure there's nothing wrong with me, and my ex is a sociopath.  Backtrack a little. Over the course of our year long ""relationship"" I have never met any of my his friends. He has mostly women friends, and although that's cool (I also have lots of guy friends, all of whom he has met), I've stated several times that I felt like it was a little inappropriate that he always had to hang out with them alone, going to dinner and watching movies, and that we'd never even met. I've heard him on the phone, saying he was at home or at ""a friends house"" when he was actually in my room, getting dressed.   He was secretive, would accuse me of 'interrogating him' if I casually asked what he did last night, or ""how was your day what did you do today?"" He would say he had plans to go somewhere, and if I asked who with, he would say ""a friend"" and get angry that I thought that was sort of a weird answer. Actually, angry is not the word, he was never angry. Disdainful and contemptuous are better, maybe almost pitying me for being so small minded and insecure.   Not normal, right? Well, I knew that, but I somehow allowed him to convince me that I was always asking too much, maybe I was immature. I also had, based on his own stories, convinced myself that he was some kind of tortured soul who had been through a lot, but if I just stuck it out, eventually he would come to trust me and things would be great.   Because this type of one sided relationship isn't very sustainable, we ended up breaking up, and then cycling through an on-again-off-again thing for the most of the past year. At the times we got back together, I was honest and upfront about any other minor fling I had (which pretty much amounts to going on a couple uneventful dates and kissing someone, once). He swore up and down that he hadn't even thought of that and couldn't believe I would never do such a thing, called me disgusting, a slut, saying how much I have hurt him and how selfish I am.  I'm going insane. I want things to work. I'm sorry for what I did. I want to be there for him. Something is wrong with me. I can fix it. I can be better. I will be nicer, that is what he needs. Someone who loves him unconditionally. I can do that.  No, this is wrong. This is not how a relationship should be. I am unhappy. I need to get out of this. I am done with it.  You want to meet for a drink? Ok yeah that sounds nice. I been thinking about you too. I'd love to see you.  (repeat cycle)  At a certain point, I am recognizing that I am caught in a cycle of verbal and emotional abuse. I try to quit but have lost many lifelines to the rest of the world. After talking to him, my few close friends believe I am crazy. And well, yeah. I was crazy. I'm emotional and temperamental, no doubt. Anyway, I realize now that he would deliberately do and say kind of fucked up things when other people were around, just to try to set me off. Then he would talk to my friends about how much he cares about me and wishes things would be better, but god look at her, what a disgusting mess. He is charming, relaxed, and moderately attractive. I can't blame my friends for being taken in by him, given what I have put up with.  If it matters, we are both in our late 20s, and well past the point where it is even a little excusable to be so horrible...  The good news is that I've escaped this situation. I've also found evidence that he has been concurrently carrying on very similar relationship with at least 3 other women, for even longer than his relationship with me! Not just sleeping with them, but going through the whole emotional roller coaster (If we count the women he's just sleeping with, I have no idea. This is also fucked up because since I thought we have been monogomous, we have unprotected sex). Not only that, but it seems like this is a continuous theme throughout his entire life. And if that was it, I would wash my hands of it and be done. But it's honestly frightening to read the way he describes causing pain to the people around him. It varies between complete indifference, annoyance, and booming pride. I don't use this term lightly: he seems to be a genuine misogynist. All of his writings pretty much describe all the things he hates about the women around him that he is sleeping with or trying to sleep with. It extends beyond them to his female friends, coworkers, and family members. He writes a lot about his pride at how much he fools people, because really he hates them all, and he is able to trick them.  I feel sympathetic to the other women in his life and want to alert them. I also want to cleanse my reputation in the eyes of everyone around us who fell for his charm.  I feel compelled to tell other people. Should I, and if so, who and how? I could message each current girl in question, but honestly, I don't want to deal with that emotionally. I can simply send them evidence, without explanation, and let them consider the situation and make their own judgements. I've thought of printing it out and mailing it to him, without explanation. Or I can basically post it on the internet to everyone we know, somewhat anonymously. Or... I don't know. The arrogant tone of his writing makes me want to 'win', I want him to see that hurting people has consequences, I want the truth to be public.  TL:DR: My ex is a sociopathic misogynist who did very mean things to many people. Should I warn the other women he's sleeping with, wash my hands of it and forget it, or anonymously show it to everyone?",r

Reason tells me I could never trust this girl again and the relationship from this point would just be a struggle, but I love her. Part of me still wants to be with her. My question to you is: would you give it another shot ? Would you still be with someone that you love but did this to you ? Do you think it could work ?",r

msgkx,msgkx,iattlhm,"Evening all, I’m not sure whether to post this into r/seduction or here, but seeing as I’m looking for a serious relationship, I figured here would be more appropriate.   General background – I have Asperger’s, until recently I found it hard to have conversations / communicate at all, especially with females. I’ve improved a lot since then, but as I’m sure you’ll appreciate, I am slightly clueless in this whole field.  I recently started going to rock/metal nights around the city I live in. I’ve found that I’ve had far more success with females here than I have ever before. I think it’s because I am genuinely enjoying myself, which I rarely do at ‘pop’ club nights (thus I appear less ‘creepy’) and generally not giving a fuck about what people think (and thus I feel more comfortable and thus appear more confident...I think) but, as I have mentioned, my experience here is limited and these are just thoughts.  Anyway, the situation at the moment: I’ve met a girl through the rock/metal society at my uni. She seems interested in me, and we’ve been on a few nights out together, and she’s slept on my sofa (nothing sexual) one night (this leads me to believe that she trusts me and feels comfortable around me).   I’m afraid of falling into the ‘friend zone’, and thus want to make a move relatively soon, and make my intentions clear. I’ve invited her to my flat to hang and listen to music and she seems enthusiastic about this. Seeing as we’d both be alone and engaging in a common interest (and sober), this would seem like the ideal time to make a move.   Can anyone offer any wisdom on specifically how to make this move? I.e. what to say? Cheers.  Edit - just read the submission guidelines. I'm male, 20 years old and she's 19.",r
cw7ewt3,3plnf5,Kakkerlak,"I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your friend.  It's very likely that his death was by accidental overdose or a natural death due to whatever caused his seizures.   The Medical Examiner will do her best to determine that.  There are a handful of crimes that the people who dumped his body could be charged with.  A similar case in Ypsilanti Township resulted in charged of ""concealing the death of an individual, conspiracy to commit concealing the death of an individual, attempted concealing the death of an individual, failing to report the discovery of a dead body and removing a dead body without the permission of the medical examiner"".  Michigan does have a criminal statute that allows prosecutors to charge drug dealers with delivering a controlled substance causing death.  Only a few cases in Michigan have resulted in conviction, as it's difficult to prove conclusively the provenance of the fatal dose, and the primary witness is deceased.

A drill made for wood just won't be able to drill through steel, especially against something that can be pushed around by the drill.  So even if the drill had a laughably long drill bit attached to it, and the driller kept on pushing foot after foot of drill bit through the wall, all it would do would glance off the steel of the computer case and/or push the computer away.  Only if the computer was somehow bolted to the floor would it be unable to move out of the way. Even still, the drill bit would still glance off the steel. It wouldn't gain any purchase.  Maybe if it hit a fan vent, okay. But fan vents aren't on the side of the case that the motherboard is on. This means the drill would have to be even longer.

fyhva,fyhva,poopersnooper,"This is recent, as in last night recent...  I'm hesitant about posting this here, but I pretty much have no one to talk to about it. There's no possible way I'd ever consider talking to my family about this. I think writing things down helps and might put things in perspective. I'd also like to know what Reddit thinks.  Yesterday I left to spend the day with my mother, grandmother and little sister. We went to an event and then shopping. Me and my little sister are close. I'm in my early twenties and she's in her mid teens. I grew up almost raising her some of the time, I do a lot for her and I love her just as much as any big sister loves their sibling.  My boyfriend stayed home to watch our one year old daughter until his mom got there to babysit and he left for work.  My boyfriend and I both have our birthdays coming up in the next two months. I was excited to get him his birthday present while I was out. After we were all done shopping, I came home and showed his mom the gift I got him and the things I got for my daughter, then she left and I put the baby to bed and got online.  My boyfriend had told me that he had no idea what to get my for my birthday and that I was hard to shop for, so I decided to see if he'd looked at my Etsy to look at my favorites and to try and steer him towards something I would like. Now, this may seem kinda crazy, but he usually just buys me something from the place he works(a popular drugstore chain)... and, well.. yeah.... That was getting kind of old.  I skipped past all the history his mom left, because I didn't really want to know what she was looking at and didn't care. When I got to my boyfriends... I almost puked.  There were links to porn alternating with links to Facebook pictures of my little sister. He had clearly been masturbating while looking at my sister.  What makes this even worse(as if that's possible) is that they were pictures I took of her... She had come over for her semi-formal so I could do her hair and makeup.. then I took her picture a bunch of times.   In the history it showed that he had looked at the engagement/wedding rings we'd picked out. Later he told me it was to show his mom the ones I liked. He had masturbated to my sister and then shown his mother RINGS for our wedding?!  I was sickened, and felt like I was about to die. I wanted to die and I wanted to shove knives in my eyes and puke until my stomach came out my throat. I was panicking and scared and confused. I was cold and disgusted and shaking.  This wasn't just some chick he worked with or someone he knew, this was my BABY SISTER!  He would tell me she was annoying and that I did too much for her!   He came home, he played dumb at first and asked me what was wrong. I lashed out at him. He admitted to it after I yelled at him and told him I knew what he'd done and not to lie.  I'll admit, I wasn't calm.. at all. I was hysterical most of the time and in tears, there would be moments of calm. I broke his cellphone, I told him if he didn't leave right that second that I'd tell everyone. He said he'd leave the next day but I insisted he'd leave RIGHT then. I packed most of his things for him and he cried. He asked me if I would give him the phone so he could call his mom and tell her he had fucked up and that he was coming to stay there. I told him he could only use it if he sat right there and made the call in front of me(he had a habit of taking the phone from me in prior fights when I tried to call my mom to come get me, so I didn't trust him with the phone).  His mom called that night after he left and I talked to her, I didn't tell her what he'd done but she asked questions and I tried to stress the severity of it. She didn't quite grasp it and said she'd try to get him to talk when he got there.  After he left he stayed at a motel because it was too long a drive and he was tired(it was past midnight and it was an hour drive). This morning he went to his moms, which is where he is now.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do or how to handle this. I feel like dieing and like I'll never be able to talk to my family again. I feel like I'll never be able to even look at a picture of my little sister.   I've been best friends with my boyfriend since we were 13-14 years old. We started dating when we were 18. We were planning on getting married.  I want what's best for my daughter. She loves her dad and he loves her. It breaks my heart.  I'd just like to know that how I'm feeling is justified and what advice I can get about this.

For all you know she might not be calling and texting you as often because she likes you and is feeling self conscious; maybe doesn't want to frighten you away. You need to find a way to see this girl more often so that you can further establish your feelings for her and continue to grow your relationship together. See her when you can and enjoy each others company when you're together. Just take things at a pace that's comfortable for you and try your best not to over think the relationship (I know that can be difficult when you care about someone) but it's important for this to be fun for the both of you.

You can call the clerk of the court and ask, maybe they can guide you to forms or a recent case you could use an example. With stuff like this any small defect (not giving the right kind of notice at the right time, not including certain information in your petition, not asking for the right remedies) could prevent you from getting what you want.  Also it would require you to go, in person, to the court in MN, likely several times even if you do everything right. If you don't do everything right it could be many times. An attorney would ensure it gets done as fast as possible, and you wouldn't have to travel yourself. Many attorneys will work on payment plans or even on contingency from the money they help you recover from your ex. Talk to the local bar association (there's one in Hennepin County and one in Ramsey County if this happened in Minneapolis or St. Paul), they can recommend attorneys for you.

She said she wasn't ready for an emotional attachment, but said it was good I told her how I felt but still felt bad about how she's not ready to commit again.

ixkja,ixkja,dGhyb3dhd2F5,"So I know I will get slammed for some of this but I will give it the full run down, but I will try and be brief.. but I  am sure that wont happen there is a tl;dr at the bottom…    I have been with my girlfriend for 4 years and we live together.  We have a pretty good relationship most of the time but recently she was drifting away.  Things like our sex life got to be like she was just allowing me to have sex with her almost as if she felt obligated, and not into it at all.  She just graduated college and during her last semester she was interning full time as well as taking classes (as per her degree program)  her internship was in the best company in the world to work for in her field.   She wasn’t talking to me about any of her feelings and they were just coming out passive aggressively, so I started to dig into her conversations with her friends.  I was reading her txt messages and facebook messages and found out that she was talking to her x boyfriend a lot. I met her when she was still dating him, but she was over the relationship- we started hooking up with the “no relationship” agreement… but it sort of came around that we were a pretty good match.  His name was in her phone under some girls name so she was obviously trying to hide it from me.  It actually took me a while to figure out who it was, but then I caught wind.  She had been talking to a few other people from back home that she knew and was saying some things that I found inappropriate for a relationship.  The other day I saw that she had texted someone from home that she has been friends for a while, and said something to the effect of “your new girlfriend is really great, our drunken mistakes need to be over”.  Usually when she goes out with this guy and his friends she gets quite intoxicated.  She sees them almost every time she goes home when I am not with her but never when I am with her.  I have always felt a little uncomfortable about this.   She was also talking to her friends about the fact that she is the queen of relationships that last too long and that she is scared that she is going to wake up one day with a ring on her finger from someone she is not in love with, and other general things like that to various people almost all of them from home.   So I am thinking that she is trying to find someone to be with that will allow her to do to me what she did to her X-BF which obviously scared me.   So the other night she was finally hired for a full time job with this company, a job that she was also talking to her friends about not wanting… we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate, I bought the dinner and then we met some friends out at a bar and I bought all of the beer as well.  I have been supporting her financially with rent payments, food, entertainment, etc for 2 years so things started to really get to me.  I felt like I was being used and she was just staying with me for convenience to get this job… you know the whole 9.  So have for a couple weeks been passive aggressively been getting annoyed with her about little things. And then at the bar that night she was getting pretty flirty with other guys in the bar, and among other things that were happening, I sort of lost it.  I told her we had to go immediately, my friend was outside and we just left, I yelled at her because she was standing on a street corner where there were a bunch of people yelling and I just needed to get out.  She got really mad at me for yelling at her for no reason, but I still did not want to bring up what I knew.  After thinking about it for a while I decided it was time to put it all out there.  I said “I am going to ask you once, did you cheat on me”?  she obviously answered no… and followed up with “I have been defending the fact that I love you for 2 weeks now and I cant do it anymore, I don’t know where this is coming from blah blah you are an asshole and im mad at you.”  So I said give me your phone, told her what I knew and she immediately turned around.  She attemped to say “you went through my phone” and of course I rebutted with this is not about me… anyway I think I reacted well and took the path of “I love you and you are killing this relationship for yourself, and you need to actually talk to me about things”  In a more supportive “its ok” manner… we talked for a while but then went home and went to sleep as it was late.   She went out of town today and I still realize that I don’t actually know if she cheated on me, which we obviously need to talk about.  She texted me today and said she was sorry for everything and that she loves me, I reiterated she needs to talk to me about these things and that relationships need to work…  I just feel like a part of me bowed down too easily, we have been through a lot together and she needs to be supported as so many things are changing in her life right now, and I want to be with her…  but there were some really hurtful things going on there.  Did I do the right thing??? Or am I sabotaging the future by not allowing this to fully come out? Tl;dr.. .read girlfriends txt messages, she said she didn’t want to be with me anymore, and with a friend from home said “our drunken mistakes have to be over, your new girlfriend is really nice”  I blew up and told her everything I knew, and think I may have been too nice about it that it may mess up the future for us.  We live together and have been talking about getting married.",r
62caqs,62caqs,ThrowItAway6879,"Coming to you from Massachusetts, I need some help regarding Intellectual Property. I create videos, graphics, icons, and ideas for an online media company. It's a small company based outside of MA.  I've been working with them for the past few years over what was basically a verbal agreement that I would make X amount of videos for them per $X amount. Now that they've brought me on full time, I asked for ""something in writing"" to further officiate my employment (I was/still am being paid as an independent contractor, therefore I file a 1099 Misc).  All my ""contract"" says is, ""You will report to X, make $X per year, starting X, with a bi-weekly payout, and you'll be doing X duties""  Not a very sophisticated contract (this is what I got after bugging them for a month and a half to get something in writing). It says nothing about my videos, graphics, ideas, or work being theirs, or my own. I'm being paid as an independent contractor and they ""see me as an employee"" (which I think is a load of shit). However, there's potential for me to branch out and do my own thing and be just as profitable.  Do I have any ground to claim that the IPs of mine are MINE and not theirs? I never signed anything saying my work was their property, nor was anything verbal.

ctzoryz,3gltod,ChillyCheese,"Most employees do not have actual ""contracts"". Contracts are usually for professions where the employer would be severely and materially damaged by you leaving. For example, if a lawyer left a firm in the middle of a high profile case, or an entertainer left in the middle of a production, the harm could be enormous. Typically these types of jobs will have contracts which stipulate a period of time, or task completion, and without living up to that you pay huge penalties. Conversely, they have to pay a lot to fire you.  Most typical jobs are at-will, where either party can walk away penalty-free at any time. Signing an agreement or offer letter at the start of employment is usually not an actual contract.  As well, being under employment contract and being a 1099-based ""contractor"" are different things.",l

In her words, she feels we ""don't have a sexual connection"" and it frustrates her and she ""doesn't know why it's like this, it's never been a problem for her with anyone else"".   and ""if anything would cause us to break up, our sex-life would be it"".     she tells me my body looks like a piece of art.  i feel the same way about the way she looks.   but when it comes to actually wanting sex she ""just doesn't see me that way"".  she doesn't really feel any lust or passion for me.    however, to further confuse things, she says when we do have sex, she enjoys it.   i have reflected on this at length, and some of the things i think haven't helped the situation are as follows:     - we didn't get much of a courting period.  due to pregnancy with my daughter very early in the relationship, we went into living-together and raising kids almost overnight.   - during her pregnancy she of course had times where she wasn't in a sexual mood, so i'd rub one out to some porn. however,  i soon learned that her previous relationship was with a porn addict, so by association she began viewing me with disdain.  - she was way more experienced sexually than me when we met, i was practically a virgin, accustomed only to vanilla sex.  so i was definitely not a Don Juan in any way, and that brought out insecurities that i know weren't very attractive.  - she requires validation through attention.   if i don't constantly shower her with attention and compliments, it affects her happiness.  i could do more in this regard, so i can work on that. i don't think she's going to ever require less attention.   maybe i'm just not manly or assertive enough. it's hard to figure out when she just says ""she doesn't know why"".   i've suggested seeing a councilor, but her opinion is that if we need to see a councilor in order to have a satisfying sex-life. then we shouldn't be together at all. i'm hoping we aren't doomed.   ** does anyone have any suggestions on how i can help influence her opinion of how she thinks of us sexually, or even just ways to help understand her better?   **    i realize that depending on our personalities there are probably different ways of approaching the problem, or perhaps any number of other variables, so i'll gladly give more detail to anyone willing to help.",r

1yjcbg,1yjcbg,Hrynkiws,"My husband and I have been married over a year, but together for 4 years. We have two kids, 10 months and 2.5 years.   Now, my husband has always been the geek- plays his computer/ xbox. And he's been going to university to become a software engineer. So obviously I knew what I was getting into. HOWEVER, the last two years I would say things have gotten worse. To the point where I have to ask him to shower ( yes you read that right) so not only am I constantly having to remind him to do his regular chores but that as well. I've been less than happy for quite a while. We have talked about things, several times but it always goes back to ""normal"". This wouldn't at all be an issue if it wasn't affecting his school work and our marriage. We are not intimate. Simply because I have a hard time being attracted to him when he smells. Having to ask him to shower before we get intimate is less than a turn on. I've tried showering with him but that in itself has turned into a chore.  I'm just usually grossed out all the time by him. He doesn't do anything but sit on his ass- so it's hard to be attracted to that. We have tried to spice things up but nothing seems to be helping. He's usually on his computer from the time we put the kids to sleep until 2am then again right in the morning before school, after school as much as he can as well. So I usually go to sleep by myself and do mostly all the work with the kids, cleaning, laundry etc. like I said I've had this talk with him and it all goes back to the way it was in less than a week. I'm enrolling into college now, plus looking for a part time job simply because he's too lazy to get one himself. We embarrassingly are living off of the money his parents give us. It's awful- this isn't the way I was raised and I have always felt extremely uncomfortable with it. I've worked odd jobs the past two years but because of daycare rates I always ended up staying home with them again and again. I've done nothing but put my all into his marriage and I'm afraid I can't do it anymore. His laziness will cause this marriage to fall apart and he doesn't fully understand that. No matter how many times I tell him.  So do I just end it? Try try again with him? I am at a loss.   Please no rude comments. Just move on if you want to bitch! Thanks.   Guess I'll add we really don't fight/argue. We just simply dont talk about things all the time. He IS a great dad. He has just become so incredibly lazy!!!!!!",r

I was wild. *she is very calm. doesn't party or even have very many friends whereas I am a bit more wild (professional rock musician)  so we were on a evening walk last night when we started talking about any regrets. and she said that right after she broke up with her first bf, she wanted to be all crazy and went to a party with her wild cousin so she could be crazy. and she ended up fucking some dude at the party. and she says she regrets it. never spoke to him again and that it wasn't that enjoyable. its her one regret.   but because of who I am (very alpha male, a bit possessive and can be jealous) it just made me rage. not at her of course but its been the only thing I've thought about since. I felt real possessive and insecure all night. it's like, I didnt think she was capable of that. shes such a home body. and it kinda threw my perception off a bit. but I've felt very insecure and possessive since then. we even made love twice last night. and she is making all the right moves and I know my feeling arent justified.

relx0,relx0,ImHerBrightest,"Ill try to avoid a TL;DR.  Since I was very young I developed the unfortunate habit of telling little white lies. Nothing huge, but just little things. I usually seem to have the urge to do so when I really care what someone thinks, which isnt too often anymore. Its a habit I have been working really hard to break.  So I started seeing this girl, and really liked her. I ended up telling some little lies. Mostly about events in my past, but really (really) pointless lies. Like I have my drivers liscense I just dont like driving. (I dont have my liscense) or that I am supposed to get a pretty large sum of money inherited soon (which at the time, I was under the impression I actually was, but things changed) but I kept saying I was.  Anyway, the relationship is becoming a lot more serious, and I see myself with this girl for a long time. But I am terrified of her meeting my family, because she may find out the truth behind some of these little white lies, and lose trust in me.  I have completely stopped telling these dumb little lies, but my question is what should I do? Should I just hope these just fall to the wayside over time from not talking about it, or should I confront it and tell her? I feel like some I could fix, like getting my license so it becomes moot. Though I feel like it could still come around and bite me in the ass,  Well damn: TL;DR: Told little white lies to girlfriend in the beginning of the relationship, and now that the relationship has become more serious I am scared of her finding out these lies and losing trust. Do I tell her, or hope they never come up and move on?  (Please no morality comments, I already feel like shit about it, and have my entire life. I am working very hard to change it, and have made a lot of progress.)",r
c1vhi17,hhobq,throwaway23305,"Hey, thanks for the response. You make some great points, although they're not quite so applicable to the situation because of some things I just didn't think of mentioning.  Anyway, we are definitely not friends with benefits. As far as I understand it, friends with benefits are two people that are there for physical comfort, with little to no emotions involved.  And she might be freaked out by the whole relationship thing, I know the distance (although some people have made it work with much larger distances) is a little daunting and that has come up in random conversations (e.g. ""sucks that you're so far away and can't visit very often""). However, I don't think that's the main reason. I know in some of our conversations on this topic (not that they've been numerous) she's mentioned that one of the factors is that there are a lot of guys in her life. The way she explains it is that she's meeting a lot of great guys that are interested in her.  That being said, she's not going along with any of their advances. Could my presence be the problem here? Would it be better if I broke stuff off so that she's ""free"" to do stuff with other guys (not that I've been against her finding a guy...)?  Basically, I suppose what I don't like about this whole situation is the sense of uncertainty. And what makes things more difficult is I don't want to harm her emotionally, because she's not very stable as it is (depressed, the meds and therapy, remember?). If it was anyone else it would be a hell of a lot easier.",r

c2fjgen,jvwju,cheesycaveman,"1.  You hit it on the head with your first remark with stop talking to her.  Take the time you have to focus on yourself, pay attention to your wants and needs rather than focusing so much energy on the past. 2.  If you work at a restaurant you can always strike up conversations about favorite foods, drinks, deserts, and if the opportunity presents itself you can buy her one on the house(if you're allowed and won't get in trouble) 3.  If this was the girl of your dreams go get her,  but my impression is that you just had strong feelings, let it be, and if the opportunity presents itself again down the road and the feelings remain go for it at that time.

The short version is this: it's ok to have those feelings happen, but you have to let it go.

Last year we had one class together and we talked a lot and she really came on to me. Unfortunately, I was a stupid freshman and I never acted on it once. I had my chance and I blew it.  Well this year, we also have one class together again and we are still talking but not as much as we did last year. Sometimes when I text her she doesn't text back even though I know she has her phone with her. Last Friday at our football game, I sat with her for the first half of the game, about an hour, and had a great conversation with her. But at the end of the game, she ended up riding home with two guys and they came over to her house. Now she is definitely not the type to do anything wrong with them and honestly I am not sure whether she sees them as just friends or more than that. And more importantly I have no idea how she currently feels about me. I can ask one of her really good friends, but I'm not sure if that would be good or not.

She's told me that she feels most comfortable when she's around me and that she feels like she's known me since elementary school. We make each other laugh constantly and talk all the time. She always takes pictures of herself on my phone and she's told me she thinks a lot of pictures of the both of us are ""very cute"" and she ""loves them"". We've also shared very personal problems and thoughts with each other and we always tell each other that ""I love you"" and ""I love you, too"". I am EXTREMELY attracted to this woman.  I am in a band and she always comes to our practices and we've embraced her as someone in the band. She always takes pictures of us and whenever we get back home she posts about spending another awesome day with us on facebook. Everything was GREAT. Then, we wanted to have a keyboardist in the band and we found this guy (m16). I've known who this guy is since 8th grade and I had no need with him so I didn't oppose him joining and he's exactly what we needed and wanted for the band.  This girl has taken a liking to him. She talks about how beautiful he is, how funny he is, how tall he is (I'm short, 5'4"") and how she can't think of anything he can't do (there's a lot of things he's bad at but that's neither here nor there).

We started having some issues when I was nearing 17, and didn't talk to her for a few months.  There she became distant and things went really down hill. Then finally, (now) I've met her for the first time...about two months ago.  That seemed to fix alot of things up. We met at a local mall (this entire time she lived, maybe at most two hours from me) and we hang out and all that and we seemed to sorta connect a bit.  We continue our talking at night and all our texting and whatnot and we start talking about plans to meet up again.  Then she starts liking this guy who recently moved in with her foster family.  Shes not sure if shes ""falling for him"" or whatever but she does like him.  Hes 28.  We're both 17.  So we met up a few days ago, and it was kinda rough, for me at least. We ate, talked, just hung out at a mall, the two of us this time (last time we both brought friends.) I introduced her to my mum, and told her she was from the internets.  I do, really, really like this girl. seeing her only made my feeling stronger, and I don't know if Love is justified at this age, but its the term we're using.  Shes got a dad that lives far away, she lives with a second family, mother was abusive etc. (shes from a broken family.) When we we're together she told me she did like this guy, but she still does love me. Shes not sure where I fit in though, just yet. Shes taking many difficult courses in school and has had alot of family worries on her mind (which are completely justified in her shitty position.)   Now, this 28 year old hangs out at the house, like i said, and depends on her to pick him up from work, and they smoke pot and drink together with the rest of the ""family."" I can see how she may like him a bit more because she is in constant contact with him.   Now the issue: I do like her, want to see her more, and we will only be able to see each other way more often now.  The second time we met, she drove out 40 minutes just to see me (she was in town) and we kissed etc. I do want to be with her, but she says needs some time to think.  The past couple weeks shes not really been texting me or calling me that much. She says shes busy, and well, it is the middle of the school year and shes taking a bunch of extra courses and she drives around alot.  Just, this guy, I don't know what to think.  We're not together, but I'd like to be and this 28 year old person figure seems to be a character she can feel comfortable around in her house, thus probably why she likes him.  Really reddit, I don't know what to think.  Its my last year in highschool, my gradfather (who I was very close too) died a few weeks ago, and my grades have been slipping, now this.  I want her, but I don't want to keep bothering her with text after text just because she doesn't reply  immidiatly.  I don't know what to make of the situation, so reddit, what should I do? How should I view this situtation, is it hopeless?   Every time I see her, things seem to just fix itself a bit more. I'm hopeful this will work out in the end, but from experiences of my past relationships things can go real sour out of the blue, and I don't want this to happen.  I'm torn up thinking about her, and just really miss her. What do?",r

iixcg,iixcg,,"Hi everyone, I need a little advice...  So, I was at a restaurant a couple of nights ago, our server was a very nice and good looking girl, we caught each others eye a couple of times and I was tempted to ask her out.   However, I was with my family and we didn't really get a chance to strike up any sort of conversation other than pleasantries and normal server/ guest chat.  Before leaving I wrote down my name and number waited for my family to leave so that I could quickly approach her, however after waiting around for a few moments it appeared that she wasn't around (maybe dealing with an issue in the kitchen or taking a break).   Not wanting to just hang around, or hold up my family, I started to move towards the door, while keeping an eye out for her, however I kinda got nervous, bottled it and left fairly quickly.   Looking back perhaps I should have waited longer. Anyway...  Regretting it, I went back yesterday to see if I could find her, but she wasn't working.  Having not really spoken with her, and now with 2 full days passing, I fear that she may not remember me, making the whole thing potentially a little awkward if I return again.  So, should I go back again today, or should I now just chalk it up as a missed opportunity? (Or should I offer to take my family to go eat there again in a few days, and create a new potential opportunity?)  Opinions? Thanks!

If she truly is going through a tough time right now, she might just want more personal space, maybe to avoid fights or displaying her problems.  I think you need to talk to her, explain how this makes you feel, talk about your worries, and get her to be straight and honest with you.

I've been wanting to watch porn with my boyfriend as I hear it's a fun thing to do, so we gave it a shot last night after a lot of foreplay. I'll preface by saying we were both incredibly turned on, the orgasms were intense, and overall made the sex very hot. I realized after, however, that I maybe have some sort of self confidence issue. During sex while we were both watching and he was doing me from behind, I made a comment about how hot the girl was. He replied saying yeah, ""she's fucking hot"", and then almost came immediately after. He pulled out in order to stop from orgasming because he wanted to last a bit longer, but I felt a moment of inadequacy from the series of events. It's not that I mind that he thinks she was hot, because she was, but he voiced it in such a way and then almost immediately came that I felt the focus of pleasure had been entirely taken away from myself.     I'm ashamed to say it made me feel pretty bad about myself, and such a feeling could just be attributed to low self esteem or the like, but I was just curious as to whether my reaction to his actions are understandable? Or if I should be more open minded about it? It made the sex very hot, but it was surprising how badly it made me feel afterwards- I felt as if at that moment he wasn't thinking about having sex with me, but instead he was imagining fucking her, and him voicing it to me just made it all the worse.

That's at least the best reason I can think that this is happening now.  His coping tendencies are all negative - he over eats (last night's dinner probably was 1500+ calories), yet is having self-esteem problems because of his weight gain. He smokes (not cigarettes) to excess (he can easily smoke a gram or more in an hour or two, and can't put it down for more than a few days). Drinking is the biggest problem (he usually puts away a 6-pack of expensive, high ABV beer a night, most nights) - he always drinks until he's drunk. I can't even fit all the empty beer bottles in our giant recycle cart. If there is any alcohol in the house at all, it won't last long, he'll drink anything.   When he's drunk, I feel extremely lonely, and sometimes he's inebriated enough that I can't even talk to him. He can be a happy drunk, but he can also be belligerent and very mean.

1niljk,1niljk,,"Hey reddit. I am a 17 year old guy who just gave his first kiss, to a girl who i was becoming very good friends with, and now i feel she is slowly becoming a complete stranger. Here goes the story. I just met this girl two days before the kiss happened and everything was going great; we'll call her hannah. I was not looking to hook up, or become boyfriend with her, i just wanted her as a friend. Anyway, we are becoming good friends amd we are in a tennis tournament away from home. None of our parents are with us. The first day passes great! We get to know each other, joke around, laugh, and have a good time overall.  The second day comes around and it is going great, until night time rolls around. A bunch of guys somehow got into her room (includong my roomate) and started hanging out there. Anyway, i was left out, so I go to their room just to tell my roomate that im going to our room, i had no plans on staying there. But somehow i got draged in, i have no idea how. So im in there and a bunch of stuff happens that is of no importance. Then there is this guy, we'll call him mark that started treating hannah like a whore, sort of, but in a playfull sort of way. He kept slapping her ass and getting all over her. So while mark finishes ""playing around with her"" and leaves the room, hannah looks at me with a face that says ""why did he do this to me, why did you not help me?"" But she did not say anything. She only yelled stop. So i offered her a hug and she hugged me and and we ended up laying on her bed cuddling with two other persons on the room. Then mark came back for like two minutes and left again. Then the other persons on the room left and we were alone. We are now alone, cuddling in her bed, by now im just thinking ""wow i cant believe im cuddling with a girl!!"" She starts calling me her teddy bear and telling me that im soft. Then, slowly, without me thinking our faces start getting closer and closer together until our noses are touching. Then i kissed her. The thing is I was not thinking of kissing her, it came naturally, sort of like an instinct, but boy did it feel great! My first kiss, i cant believe it!! Those were probably the best moments of my life so far. We keep going at it for like five minutes until my roomate and mark knock on the door. So she stands up and opens the door and mark takes her like 15 feet away and starts talking to her (probably about what we did in there. I did not hear) and i just left. I did not say goodbye i just waved, but i dont think she noticed. Here is where we started drifting appart. She sends me a message that says ""im sorry"". Since i dont know why shes sorry i just ask her about what. She tells me that we should not have done that and that she is sorry. About six or seven messages later we ended up in good terms i told her not to worry, that she did nothing wrong, and she told me ""thanks for being so nice about it."" I took that messgae as her saying it ok, its done dont worry. So the next day rolls around and it goes pretty well. There are some awkward silences but thats all, nothing big imo. We never talked about what happened that night. Then today rolls around, and today i felt everything just plummeted. She seemed like she did not want to talk to me. She did not make it that obvious though, she talked to me normally, but just ended the few converstaions we had abruptly. I send her some nessages saying random stuff regarding stuff we had done. From here on i have no idea of how to explain whats going on but i will try. I hope some of you guys know what is going on.  My mind is blank now. Im just going to give a short summary of what happened today while i saw her. I saw her at dinner and tried making some small talk, it did not go well, then about 40 minutes later i send her a message saying if she wants to share the melon i gave her but instead she replies with ""do you have quarters?"". I go give her the quarters at the laundry room and she is alone with another guy. No problem i think. There she only talks to the other guy, she only tells me thanks. Then Hannah and the other guy go downstairs to the hotel lobby. They seem pretty attached to me sort of friendly/romantically?, they sort of one arm hug, and then my friend told me that he almost got it on with hannah, i dont know if i should believe that. I stayed there a while and talked with the group for a while and there she seemed normal, but when she is with me she seems sort of nervous in a way, but that is not the word im looking for.   So thats it. Ever since we made out i feel that she is not giving me the same amount of attention she was before that night. She still talks to me but i feel its less and less every time with her trying to cut off the converstaion early when its only us.  But i also feel im overthinking this to much, what if all of this is my imagination?? I got a whole lot of emotions after the kiss and i guess im still trying to process how to be around her. Should i continue the same? Should i pretend nothing happened? Should i be more romantic/flirty? Should i just give her some time? Either way, maybe nothing is wrong and im just over analyzing everything and thinking and/or feeling something completely different from that what she is experiencing and i have no idea what to do or whats going on.  I hope some of you guys know whats going on, or have some insight on these types of experiences. I only want to know if i should talk to her about what happened and how to act, or if i should pretend nothing happened and keep being the same.  Tl:dr made out with a girl im barely becomeing friends with, and now it seems we are drifting appart. It may only be me that feels this way because I got this sudden wave of emotions and started over analyzing everything. I dont know what to do.",r

1e6gsn,1e6gsn,Dance-monkey-dance,"My boyfriend (19m) and my best friend (f19) went round a friends house last night, I was invited but declined due to exams in a few weeks. Boyfriend - let's call him A - used to have a crush on my best friend - lets call her B - until literally just before we got together (about a year ago) (did i mention she is smoking hot) and B did consider going there, but she is a bit of a relationship phobe, and he never asked the question. Anyway, last night they were round a mutual friends house (just 3 of them) and got really hammered on a mixture of tequila and whiskey and playing drinking games. I am assuming that they both stayed over as I got a drunk text at about 4am, but I don't know, A didn't tell me. Also as it is a small group of people I am guessing they are all going to be bunking up together, which doesn't make me totally comfortable. They have shared a bed before at a party i wasn't at (there was one other person in there with them) and B was going on about how A twitches in his sleep, which you practically have to be laying on top on him to feel. In addition, I am kinda worried cause B hasn't been totally hammered around A before and I know that when she is drunk she will get with a guy simply because she's bored. I love her, and she is my best friend and ordinarily has good morals but I just get the feeling that something could happen there.  I have been honest with them both in the past and said look I'm not going to be a crazy girlfriend but just so everyone is on the same page I am not totally comfortable with you guys sleeping in the same bed, but I understand its my problem not theirs. I am not going to ban him from seeing her or have a go at him or anything like that. He is very shy and I don't want to make him loose a close friend who he gets on really well with as that is not fair. I am not the jealous type, I have had people come up to me and tell me that they are in to him, to which my response is well I find him hot so why would I tell anyone else off for feeling the same. I get on really well with any one else he has ever been associated with him in that way. It's just B really makes me nervous.  A is an amazing boyfriend, he does nothing wrong and I could not ask for more, I'm not worried about him being unfaithful but like I said, it's is something about being with B that sets me off. I really hate feeling like this and I don't want to push all my crazy on to him as that isn't fair at all. I try really hard to be logical and rational and I don't want his relationships with friends to suffer. What do I do?   TLDR; boyfriend in intimate situation (at a night in i didnt go to) with a girl he used to have a be really in to - who is also my best friend.

m3zjy,m3zjy,,"Throwaway account here, (ex) boyfriend avid redditor.  We've been together for two-years and I guess we broke up a few days ago officially?. He's 23 and I'm 26. Me and ""Larry"" have had a pretty crazy relationship. We met on a whim and it was extremely tumultuous at first because he believed he had a limited time to live (according to a medical blunder, that I always found suspicious after) so he was always drinking. We fell in love pretty fast. There was always something holding me back from fully being vulnerable. I was scared because he compared me to his ex (and has done so throughout this ""breakup""). Then miraculously he didn't have a life-threatening illness. I always found it really fishy that he didn't press charges on his doctor for misdiagnosing and causing emotional distress.  Then things started to kind of go down hill, I went from being single to being married. We spent most days together. We almost always were drunk together. I was beginning to get tired of being drunk, as I have school and work. Then I just felt we didn't have anything together really but drunken mornings. I started becoming volatile towards him. When we went to London I flipped out on him because he spilled liquor on my pants, then because he held on to me ripped my jacket pocket, so I ripped his sweater (while he was in it). So I started becoming really angry and abusive. Every time we were out we were drinking. Then he blamed his drinking on me. Or if not drinking together, drinking with all of his friends. I would wake up and try to do other activities other than drinking but he would never wake up on time. Always with his friends, I started feeling like one of his buddies too.   I honestly never felt I fit in with his friends. They were either in there just hit 21 stage or the bartenders. All in all I felt I was in an alcoholic world and drinking didn't seem fun but dangerous. I would constantly break up with him and then feel shitty because I know that he's a nice guy. We traveled together, we didn't do many activities outside of bar hopping, but he always attempted to take care of me both emotionally and financially.   *Fast forward to August:*  We return from one of our Euro trips and we had planned and set and talked about all the things to do in the summer in NYC. He meets some guy at a bar on a random night and they become bff's. He leaves the first week of August to his friend's hometown. I became disgruntled and jealous since we both have school and this is the summer is the time we can spend together without school or work or excuses that it's too cold. I broke up with him for the week. It was hell. I missed him, but I was angry and even more so that I condoned the whole trip (thinking he would never find a cheap enough flight to go anyway.  When ""Larry"" returned we tried to work things out but I was so let down by him. We hadn't really had sex because he was always drunk or hung over or I was late to work etc. I felt a little neglected. So as I bar hopped with friends I caught someones eye who seemed OK. He was a foreigner and he was attractive. So I leave with him but I didn't get farther than being nude making out with him. I wasn't even aroused by it and I left him high and dry. I felt guilty and told ""Larry"" and he said it was ""Ok"" he made out with two of our ""friends"". It's been on and off, high and low since then. I get drunk because I want to forget about this whole thing and then I get angry or we go out and we do the same stuff that we've left off on.  I love him a lot. I kind of worry that he might be an alcoholic. I've been taking anger management and been slowing down a lot on drinking. We haven't really spoken since end of October and it was because I was so drunk and a freak accident happened that I called him and told him to forget about me and move on.            As soon as I sobered up I realized it wasn't the right move. I apologized and he never returned my calls or texts.  I've been pretty stressed out and sick and write to him daily in hopes that he could see that I'm still here or reply with move on leave me alone. Either one would give me relief. I see him 2 days ago as I was eating after bar hopping with friends. He comes into the restaurant and we both greet each other cordially. I finish my meal and leave. In the station I realize that I should talk to him and see what is really going on. The least I could get is an official goodbye or something concrete. I ask him and he says ""yes we are over"" and I said ""are you sure? pinky promise and I'll move on"" which he replied ""No I can't do that. You're asking me to predict the future"" and then he tells me ""You're guilting me into staying with you"" and I look at him a little angrily because it's not guilt and then he says ""just take care of yourself and everything will be fine"" and ""We can't be friends if you don't take care of yourself"".   I've done everything he has done to me when I've left, from calling, texting, e-mailing to confronting him in public. He left the station with his friend I went back to my friends. He texted me again ""take care of yourself. you promised you would, in time you'll heal."" I'm not at all sure if he has left. I don't know why he couldn't just tell me that it was all over, ""yes I can predict the future and you're not part of it"". It all sounds rather teenager-ish writing it, but we are still friends on FB and we maintain our ""in a relationship"" status although not with our names on it. I've unsubscribed from him and have decided to stop posting my location since we only did that to show each other where we were.              Are we over? Really? Why can't he just say good bye? Also he compares me to his ex who is suicidal and destructive, maybe it's because he thinks I'm not strong enough to withstand an outright break up? Why does he make me feel like I'm in limbo? Just sever ties and we can go our separate ways, in an adult manner. Yes it will hurt but at least I can work on moving on. Of course it wouldn't of been what I wanted in the end, but at least I could feel that it was over officially and I could mourn it appropriately. He still won't return my texts or calls or emails. I've decided since yesterday night to no longer contact him. I just wish I knew that I could move on without him interrupting me mid month or next month after he might or might not get over what he's going through. Or that if I see him in public again I can just smile and walk right by him without feeling like I am being a douche.  **TL;DR** Broke up with boyfriend of 2 years a few days ago. The whole decision was made in 8 minutes and was left very ambiguous. Don't know how to move on or if I should wait a while and then move on? Or if its officially over and I can mourn it? I don't know really.",r
l52y4,l52y4,throw234,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that this is my first ""proper"" committed relationship and that's why I need help!   My issues are with physical contact and communication.  I've been in a relationship with my girl now for about 9 months, at the start she was very touchy and we'd often sit and play around together, just basically being very tactile. The sex was frequent and good and we just generally got on fantastically!  However, as of the last couple of months the sex has dropped to sometimes once a fortnight and even worse, whenever I try to kiss her or hold her affectionately she'll (in a semi-joking manner) hide her face or curl up. Basically, I have to fight to get any contact from her.  What's worse is that whenever I try to ask her what's up or to open a dialogue she clams up, says she's fine and responds in little more than yes or no. For example, this morning when we woke up I asked her if everything was alright between us ('cause she'd been cold to me the previous night) and she said that it was fine and that she was going to stay in bed 'cause she was sleepy. Now I may be overanalysing but she wanted to get out of bed before I raised the question and after I had it seemed she just wanted to avoid me.

She doesn't know that I've been sneaking in to their apartment for 3 years now while she's at work. She never lets her out of her sight. She's not allowed to walk out of their apartment alone (except: buy groceries nearby, school stuff, etc). We've never been out on a date even though I've known her family for 3 years now. Her mom thinks I'm disrespectful towards her (the way I talk, the way I act, etc). People who know me would disagree and tell her so. I would say that I probably do come off as disrespectful, but I only talk to people that way who I assumed knew me and was close to me. I talk differently to strangers and acquaintances. She has her own vision of what her daughter's BF should be like and that ain't me.   My GF and I talked and we (mostly me) came up with:  a) I could pretend to be what her mom wants me to be though of course it would be fake and I would try to avoid her as much as I can, or  b) she can ignore her mom, stick with me (we're in our mid-20s, she can support herself, I have 1 year of school left),  c) we give up, she can find somebody her mom approves of, I can go back to being forever alone (I'll probably be too lazy, too unmotivated to find another girl, I was just lucky I met her in class 4 years ago when we were starting college).

However, it seemed that whenever she would get a text and I was closer to her phone I would get it for her and it would almost always be him (probably 8/10 times.) we got married last month and I noticed that one night on our honeymoon as we're laying in bed they're texting each other and I'm basically getting ignored(more physically than verbally) which really bothered me. While this situation has seemed to have stopped I noticed a couple of days ago she her and a different ex recently became friends on Facebook, this pissed me off because he had caused a lot of problems in the beginning of our relationship and almost broke us up a couple of times(I had asked her to stop talking to him and she did for over a year now as far as I know).

We spend an equal amount of time together and apart. We have a lot in common. We're basically perfect for each other. Our only flaw is that we both lack communication skills when it comes to discussing ourselves and our relationship.  About 4 or 5 years ago, I noticed that things became stale. Neither one of us really addressed this change, other than me telling him he's being too clingy and to give me space. Ever since, I've not shown much in terms of affection towards him. It's always him that approaches me.   I've finally spoken to him recently about how I've lost interest. We had a good talk, and I told him I was working on trying to change myself. But the more that time passes, the more I'm beginning to realize that I think I've fallen out of love with him. I still care deeply about him, and don't want to cause him any harm. But I can honestly say that if he were to tell me that he was no longer happy and wanted to end the relationship, I'd be OK with it.

It wasn't *only* my depression that caused us to break up, he was really not supportive and horrible sometimes too. I didn't want to leave him for a long time because I loved him, but it just wasn't a good match.  This is not necessarily what I think you should do, because only you know what is right for you, but just letting you know you're not alone.",r
d21qvn9,4enjgs,PrecedentialAssassin,"Basically he has a lot of waiting on his hands. It could be over a year before he gets a plea bargain or goes to trial. If he bonds of, he'll be on pretrial which is pretty much probation until then. He won't be allowed around kids, has to work, has to meet a po monthly, etc.   How much was his bail? That'll be a good clue as to how severe things could be?   And if he has the resources, getting a great attorney instead of a court appointed can be critical to the severity of his eventual sentence.   Also, someone said distance yourself... I totally disagree. If this person is important to you, reach out. It doesn't mean in any way at all you support his actions.",l

dglrz2i,66w0wc,sabian92,"No idea regarding anything else, but have a play with this: https://www.gov.uk/check-british-citizen  It'll let you know if the wee one is a British Citizen at birth or not, can be one at some point, or can't be at all. Being born to a British parent doesn't automatically make you British (and actually the child might have no more right to British Citizenship than your daughter depending on circumstances) so it's a bit of a complex one. I'm not a solicitor etc so I don't know though, but I would seek legal advice about it.  As you can see from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law), British nationality law is quite complex!  [This](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) is the UK Government page for citizenship enquiries as well, just so you have it to hand.  [This page is somewhat relevant](https://www.gov.uk/register-british-citizen/born-before-2006-british-father) but obviously the child will be born in 2017/18 so... I don't know.

dvb0syt,82j6u0,sweatinballs,"&gt;And just letting them handle it is what the problem stems from though, is that both my boss the supervisor, and the owner, both want this guy gone because he's deliberately trying to cause problems and a rift within the shop.  This maybe so. Has management called him out for saying stuff like ""white people stuff"" and explaining that stereotyping of any race isn't tolerated in this work environment? Your management shouldn't be goaded by him either. He's allowed to think and believe that the person put in charge isn't qualified. But keeping your mouth shut when he's goading you is the best thing to do. If he continues making stereotypes, document it by writing him up according to your discipline proceedure. If he's refusing doing what he's told, fire him for insubordination.   You should be having performance reviews and set goals for employees. If his performance is poor, document what need to be addressed and if it's not done, let him go.   Key is to document everything! Other employees are allowed to think what they want, and undoubtedly he's going to do a lot of talking while you start to apply pressure. Ignore it unless he violates company policy. Don't try and set the record straight with other employees and go into detail. Someone is likely to say something stupid and it's not about them.",l

cf8hswc,1x66ju,inremarriagecases,"&gt;Amicus briefs are not really intended for the layperson to file. Unless you feel that you have a specific matter that no one else is going to handle, you're likely not going to receive leave to file. As is, without an attorney assisting you, it's unlikely you'd receive leave, anyhow; there's little to no pro se assistance for appeals.   Thank you.  I'll edit this in to the filing question: what type of attorney should I contact who would be able to file it for me, once I've passably written it?   &gt;You're better off contacting one of the organizations that will likely file a brief and talking to them.  For various reasons, this unfortunately won't work.  Everyone is working out of their own underfunded pocketbooks, nobody has any time (state legislature is in session and anti-discrimination is a huge concern right now), different aims by different orgs, etc.  &gt; As is, your read of the situation appears to be correct - your brief would need to be filed by 2/10.

hb7hz,hb7hz,,"(my original post never showed up, although it did say it posted, so if it does happen to surface, please post here)  I've been in a relationship with a guy for just a little over a year. I love my boyfriend very much, and I care a lot about his feelings, and our relationship (outside of a few little arguments here and there) is going great. Here's the problem- I'm sort of crushing on one of my friends. Here's the bigger problem- he lives in a different state, and we're friends through a MMO game. We talk on Skype for hours, every day, and I've known him for a little over a year, as well. I'm not sure if he likes me or not, but there have been subtle hints, here and there. He's gotten gifts for me, and has planned a few little surprises, which have meant a lot to me, and have been super unexpected, and welcome, considering my boyfriend is not really the kind of guy who goes out of his way to surprise me. He's coming to my state to check out a college (which is really close to where I live), and to visit family, and of course, me. He'll be here for only a few days, and in that time, I'm going to see him. I'd like to hang out a few times with him, without my boyfriend being around, and I don't want to necessarily sleep with this guy, but I want to find out how he will act around me without my boyfriend being around. Also, I sort of want to kiss him, but I am afraid that is an awful thing to do since I'm already in a relationship. I know I have a lot more in common with the ""internet guy"" than I do with my actual boyfriend, whom I've still got a very strong and healthy bond with, and I would never want to do anything that would hurt him, but I'm afraid my curiosity is taking over. Any suggestions/hints would be really appreciated, I'm in a tough situation. Like, is it worth the risk of potentially letting this other guy know my feelings, or should I just drop it and live my life as I already was? Oh, an additional note- my boyfriend knows the guy is coming down obviously, and has talked to him a few times before, so they know each other, and are on friendly terms.",r

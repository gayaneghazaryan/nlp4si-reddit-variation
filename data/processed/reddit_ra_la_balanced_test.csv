kaoa0,kaoa0,,"So, me and my gf had a *great* relationship over the last 8 months.   Just spent an amazing summer together and all, until she moved back home because she graduated from college.  We aren't too far apart and I have the chance to see her every 2-3 weeks thanks to a cheap bus.  Last Sunday I met her and we had literally the most amazing day ever, spending it in parks and museums and a restaurant in the city where she's from. She was very sad when I had to leave and before I got home she sent me an email as a follow up. How amazing everything is and how much she loves me. That was Sunday.  Since then we've been Skyping a lot and until *yesterday* everything was perfectly fine. We kept texting throughout the day and video-chatted at like 8pm. First, eveythings totally great again, but 3 days ago she told me that her grandmother is about to die.  Of course this makes her extremely upset. But I tried to comfort her and let her know she can always call me and talk to me. I even made her laugh and tried to raise her mood and told her about my own similar experiences.  Now here is the problem. When we video chat I easily get distracted. I talk to her but now and then (not all the time) I check FB, Reddit or answer other IM's. She told me that her Grandma issue is making her really sad and it brings up all the things that bother her.  She became very quiet and serious about how Im always distracted when we talk. I admitted this and said I understand her and will do my best to keep focused. She simply wants to use our time to the full extent, since she now realizes that her grandma is dying.  After we hung up she called me and we talked about it again 40min later. Then she just whispered ""I love you"", almost forced. And wanted to go to bed.   15min later she was on FB and said she couldnt sleep after I IM'd her. She then just signed off. No goodbye, goodnight or anything.  I sent her a MMS for the morning (before I went to sleep) when she gets up for work to cheer her up, but no reply. When I ask how she is she said she has puffy eyes (probably cried a lot). Then I responded how work is and how she is...no reply.  I waited until tonight to call her and give her some time. She wouldnt pick up, but was online in FB. I IM'd her to inform her about something, she just said ""Okay"". I followed up asking how everything is. She replied ""I'll ttyl"" and signed off.  I think she's really affected by her family issues now, but I don't get why she avoids me like that. She could just tell me she needs time.  My guts are feeling bad and I feel dizzy about this...it went from everything great, smiley and virtual kisses to avoidance and silence.  I just want to hear some outside opinions. I won't bother her and I try to suck it up. The last thing she needs now is some needy bf bugging her.",relationshipadvice

cfjtz0v,1ybkpu,mmimsy,"I'm sorry you're going through this. It definitely confusing to have somebody seem distant and confused, only to send you subtle messages that they miss you after your breakup. Have you considered he may need some time to himself to assess the situation and how he feels about himself and about you?  I'll be honest, a few months ago, I (23/F) went through a really bad breakup (42/M). There was a huge age disparity but we had so much in common and I thought I was going to marry him eventually. Long story short, after three years, he turned out to be an abusive jerk. After we broke up, I really got to know myself. I live by myself and figured out my interests, assessed what I truly want in a partner, and just stopped caring about my ""type"" or what I thought I wanted in a partner, from myself.    Maybe it would be helpful for you to have a little time to yourself to figure out what you need and want in life, and from a partner. Keep an open mind. He seems like a nice guy, so it may be helpful to let him know you understand he may be going through a confusing time, but you'd really like to pursue things in the future.

The sheriff pulled out his phone and I tapped and then he asked me ""Who is (little brother's name)"". Well I told the truth that it was my little brother. He asked for my I.D and wrote me a ticket. He put onto the ticket "" No fare"" which means that I didn't pay to ride the train. However I did and do pay monthly for the bus pass as my little brother (age: 15) does not use it. I use it to save money from a community college bus pass, and this is the first ever that I have been given a ticket.

I checked with ""Metro's Customer Code of Conduct"" (6-05-230-A is the code used for the violation) and it doesn't say anywhere specifically that I must use a tap card under my name.

7cqd15,7cqd15,mjthrow12,"Location: TX  So I met someone new and we are really, *really* hitting things off.  He is a cannabis user (which I don't have a problem with) but he carries a lot of paraphernalia in his car and is *not* very subtle about it.  He keeps a not-very-pocket-sized vaporizer and herb cartridges in plain view next to the gear shifter, and his car is in general pretty disorganized so who knows what else is in there, really.  He uses febreeze or whatever to cover up the smell, and has apparently been doing this for awhile including the occasional traffic stop without any issue.  I am not a drug user of any kind and so I don't really have any idea what I'm getting into, in terms of either legal, relationship, or etiquette advice.  My sense is that he's into me enough to adjust his behavior somewhat to make me more comfortable if I asked, but I'm not sure what I can/should ask for.  I guess my primary concern would be getting hit with a constructive possession charge, so maybe I need to ask him to keep his stuff under his own seat?  Alternatively I could either ask him to keep it out of his car completely (which may or may not be rude?) or just not get into his vehicle at all (which may also be rude?).

Is he very close with his family? He may just be coming from a different environment where being around his family that long isn't a stressful occasion for him so he can't understand that it would be for you. Honestly I'd just reiterate again that a week with his family sounds more stressful than enjoyable to you, and leave it at that. Since you've already told him you'll go and given him money, you maybe should go this time? I'm not sure. Be firm next time if this comes up again, and don't go if you don't want to.

You may start another relationship and end up in the same kind of situation. Living with someone in a relationship tests all of your patience. You need to be aware of your habits, and be considerate of the other persons needs. Hopefully, it is a mutual relationship where you both make compromises with your differences and work towards mutual happiness. Do you each have private space and time where you live? That can be a factor too. If she feels like she has given up every part of who she was before, she may be needing that space.

eyj1r,eyj1r,,"A tale as old as time: ""She just got out of a bad relationship"". Basically, I met this girl around Halloween, so we have been friends for about 2.5 - 3 months. Ever since we met, we have been really close friends, to the point where she trusts talking to me about anything, and I do the same (So far so cliche). Anyways, one night she and another friend were spending the night over at my dorm, and we were laying on a mattress on the ground all together talking and just being goofy, and she and I began to snuggle up together with her body curled up against mine and my arm around her.  My one friend went to sleep leaving just me and her awake talking. Our faces got closer and closer and WE kissed, not she and not just me, but WE. The kissing continued through the night until we saw it best that we try to sleep. The next morning after my friend left, we moved over to my bed in my dorm and continued to lay against one another and talk and kiss and the like. I have always been very clear and honest with her about my feelings for her and how wonderful I think she is, but after that night, she reminded me ""I am not looking for a relationship right now, I want to be friends with the next guy I date for a while before we date"". Which I understand completely. I am a big proponent for knowing someone on a good friend level before an intimate/physical level. BUUTTT! Right after saying that, she says that is another reason she is interested in getting to know me better over time in our friendship. A completely logical assumption from this would be ""she wants to get to know me better because she is interested in more than just friendship later down the road"". I told her how I felt about her, and she told me she felt the same about me, but just simply didn't want a relationship right now.  Now starting the New Year, I feel close to her, just like I do as her friend, but I don't feel any more special than any other friend of hers. Is it completely irrational of me to feel disheartened by my lack of feeling specified affection? Now, we never hang out with just the 2 of us, nor does she seem to show interest in being around just me. It might just be me feeling neglected because of my last relationship leaving me hurt from her cheating on me, but I just feel played at this point. It is hard to think rationally and complete when you are the one suffering from whatever problem is occurring, so I turn to you reddit. Help a brother out :P  I care about this girl so damn much! When I wake up she is who I think about, and she is the last person I invision when I go to sleep. She is always on my mind, and I think the world of this girl. But at this point in time, I feel like I'm only going to hurt myself by feeling this way about her.  What do I do? Do I back off and stop trying to advance our friendship toward that of a relationship, and let her go on and see if she comes around, or do I continue in my hopelessly romantic pursuits for the girl of my dreams?  Feel free to enlighten/dishearten me as much as you wish, I am yours for the taking reddit, hit me with a big bursting bag of sense.

Today when I came in I saw that the form had been taped to the “remember wall” , they tape stuff there to make as a reminder, and I felt really uncomfortable with that because I felt it was poor attempt at protecting my privacy. Reason being is because on the form is my social security number. Literally anyone who walked passed it could jot it down and do whatever they wanted. Not only this but it’s behind the bar of my job so if a customer realized what it was I’m pretty sure they could use there phones camera to zoom in on it.  &gt;  &gt; After staring at it uncomfortably for a while I asked another manager why was it there that’s when he proceeds to tell me it’s the “reminder wall” and he took it off and put it in the office? Like is that not poor managing? What should I do or say?      --- LocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice

jvvky,jvvky,,"I am so devastated and lonely right now reddit, thank you for reading and for giving any advice you may have. I feel like I may have lost the love of my life.   I am a 24 year old male, she is a 27 year old female, and we both live in a major city. We met while we were in school and have lived together for four years. I graduated in May from University with a bachelors in Film and Video and have not been able to find a job. Though money has been a problem for me, She has never supported me, and we always split everything. I have experienced deep depression on and off for the past few years, and she wanted me to get treatment, which I had made attempts at but never followed through with. She graduated at the same time with her masters and landed a good job doing what she wants to do. Things have been tough lately because she understandably resents me for not having found a job, and her coldness made me have a hard time treating her like I should. I've never abused her, and in fact I have consciously made an attempt to be more pleasant with her, and things have been getting better for me the past couple of weeks. I quit playing video games during the day because they are a time waster, I quit smoking trees to remove the stress of drug testing, and have been working out when she smokes and when I get up in the morning.   Today, she came home from work and told me that she got a hotel for this weekend, and she wants me gone by Monday. I can't say it was out of the blue, because we called off the date we had set for the wedding because we didn't think we were ready. However, we never talked about this or me leaving, especially on such short notice. She expects me to stay with my parents who live out of town, even though I am looking for a job and want to live here in the city. I can't move out of town because I don't have a car and depend on public transportation, and I feel I would stagnate even more.   She says that she needs a break and wants us to grow independently as people. That she can't wait on me anymore and it is killing her. She says she's never loved anyone like she loves me, and that I'm the only person she has ever wanted to marry. I said I would prove to her that our love was not in vain, and that I would show her that I can be the man she wanted to marry. She begged me to please prove it to her and said that we can have a future together if I do.   In my heart I believe her, and I want this to happen more than anything, but I honestly don't know if she was just trying to make me feel better or not. I believe she has been faithful to me, and I don't think she's seeing anyone else. However I am hurting so much because I feel I failed her, and there is nothing I can do right now to change her mind.  So, Reddit, here is my plan. I am going to get up every morning and run. Losing weight and getting healthier is a top priority. I already have some promising leads on production jobs and will continue looking for a wage job in the meantime in the city. I am going to visit career services at my university and see if there is any help there in the job department. I am going to see a psychiatrist to work out this and other issues, and hopefully get back on anti-depressants. I may have to live with my parents and put my stuff in storage until I can move somewhere in town. Hopefully I can find a roommate in the city so I don't have to move in with my parents, and have a place of my own in town. I'm thinking about getting a bike, so I can get around more easily on public transportation. Aside from these things, does anyone have any tips on getting her back? I feel if I was working and supporting myself, in my own place, healthier, happier, and giving her space, that I would have more self-confidence and she would see that I have been busting my ass.   Is it possible to get her back? Do I even want her back? Leaving me like this after the promises we made to each other makes me wonder what she really feels and if I can trust her the way I have been. I know my situation has hurt her, but I don't think she understands how hard it has been for me. I just want to talk to her and be with her, but that is exactly what she doesn't want right now. She said she was not giving up on me, and I am not going to give up on her.   What to do?  Edit: I've been separating our things since she left. I don't think I can go back to doing that tonight...",relationshipadvice

I have seen my fair share of crazy lady freak outs and have lost a few good coffee makers to them. Learn to draw the line. If she says something mean to you, say ""I will not tolerate your verbal abuse""  If she is upset about your father coming to visit tell her ""too bad"" or my personal favorite ""tough"". If she responds with a proclimation of you not respecting her, tell her you disagree and break it down for her. Tell her you really want your father to visit and you were not looking for her imput or permission, but rather telling her that you have made a choice and that this is what is going to happen.

dsb4z,dsb4z,anotherthr0wawayy,"Long time lurker here, though this is my first reddit post. I've been with a girl for about two years now. In the past few months, she has developed serious anger issues. I guess I've always known she is a ""broken"" girl...she's had an abusive mother and a terrible relationship with her father. She's always had problems managing her anger and she takes it out on herself by punching herself in the thigh usually. I did the stupid thing and tried to play therapist and help her get over her problems but it has obviously failed. Our relationship became strained and fights started to become more frequent. My friends said I should break up with her and I knew they were right but I pushed that out of my mind because I love and care for her. Fast forward to the past month or two...we had a pretty serious fight over her drunkenly flirting with another guy over the course of a few nights. I came home tonight and she was furious for reasons I still do not know. I asked her to explain what was bothering her, but instead she destroyed our bedroom and woke up the neighbors with her slamming and punching of things. She punched herself in the face...no doubt neighbors will think I abuse her. For the first time, I was genuinely scared of her and thought she was going to seriously hurt one of us. She desperately needs professional help. I pleaded with her to consider it and she told me to go hell. At this point I have little interest in continuing the toxic relationship, but I really want her to get better. I'm afraid to kick her out or end things because I'm certain she will seriously hurt herself, destroy the apartment, or do something equally damaging or dangerous. It was so heartbreaking to  see someone with whom I once shared a wonderful, loving relationship, so broken and anguished.  TL;DR: Does anyone have any advice or experience helping someone realize that they need to seek professional mental help?",relationshipadvice

She specifically said yesterday that she's not looking for a rebound, but the 2nd time they broke up, she sent me a text message that sure sounded like she was looking to me to be a rebound.  Problem is, I'm really, really terrible at reading women, and so I'm not even very sure of that. How do I elucidate her intentions without being confrontational and possibly wrecking things?  Note: I do not want to be the rebound. While I don't have a girlfriend, and sex after a 1+ year dry spell would be awesome, I've read enough and seen enough movies to know that would be a bad idea right now.

1kjq78,1kjq78,Sorrythishappened,"Hello all, this will be a big one. I'm really sorry if it's broken up and bad storytelling. It's 5am and I'm running on hardly any sleep or food.  Here's the back story Im 22/f and my boyfriend is 25/m, 3 very happy years together with 1 year living together full time. We have talked about getting married in a few years time, and were planning to purchase a house together within the next year.  He is my best friend and has been since we started dating. We had a fantastic fun and passionate start to our relationship, we have so much in common and we have a great time together.   I moved in to his place after completing school just over a year ago, we looked for a place together but ultimately decided I move in with him as it was cheap, had a good location and great landlords. His place was only 550 sq feet, but for the last year we have made it work with our two dogs. It has had it's ups and downs, but lately has been on a huge downswing.   I got into a bit of an argument with his brother- it was nothing serious but his brother took it to a whole new level. He began full on insulting me and humiliating me over the course of a weekend in front of family and friends. As a result, I left extremely upset with my boyfriends brother, my long weekend was ruined and I felt hurt my boyfriend didn't defend me better. His argument was that ""he's blood and you shouldn't listen to him and be so upset"". Which I understand, I was not trying to break him up with his brother, I just wanted to see some defense for me.   The following weekend he hung out with his brother again, I was upset- why would he hang out with the guy who ruined our previous weekend? Boyfriend said that it was so he could figure out what his brothers problem was with me after so long getting along. I figured fair enough and away they went.  He returns and tells me the issue is from the initial argument we had, that was in my mind extremely small but apparently left him upset. I sent his brother a text message apology (we don't see him very often) and asked if we could drop the issue and forgive each other. He said fine but made no attempt to apologize for his humiliating behavior.   The night after I send the response I see a text on my boyfriends phone from his brother asking ""so did you break up with her yet"" and telling him to be a man and do it. This was the first I've heard of this as we are happy together. We talked about it and I felt confident in our relationship again.   The following few weeks were happy. We had fun playing video games and hanging out like we used to with very little bickering and fighting.   This past Monday I left for a business trip. He kissed me goodbye and all was well. We talked a few nights and he seemed very distant, I figured he was just enjoying himself but had an underlying concern at some comments he has been making.   Friday morning at the airport I sent a message at 6am saying ""I'm on my way home! See you soon!"" His response was that ""____ I'm sorry but we need some healthy time apart. When you get home you're moving back in with your parents for a bit. I can't stand all of the bickering and fighting and it's driving me insane."" I quickly called him in a panic and he told me he had already packed many of my belongings the night before and had been feeling this way for a few weeks and that we could talk about it when I got home.I cried almost my entire plane ride. I couldn't get it out of my head and I spent the morning miserable.   I returned home to every single one of my belongings overturned and put in boxes. Right down to kitchen ware and toiletries and socks. I arrived at noon and he didn't finish work until 4 pm. So we couldn't talk about it until then. I spent the afternoon taking loads of my belongings to my parents house 1 hour away.   When he came home from work we talked about it. He felt that living together was driving us apart (it was- he never wanted to have sex and was constantly stressed out). He felt like we couldn't have talked it out so he ""took the step of packing my belongings and kicking me out in hopes we could work through it with our own space"". We had a good heart to heart.   I told him I felt so betrayed, I didn't want to go back to living with my parents and I had built a life in his town and was finally happy. He said he was sorry but he couldn't live with me anymore in such a tiny house but he would support me and help me move back in to my parents. Since we both don't want the relationship to end we decided the space was needed so we would still see each other but with limitations.   We made plans to move me in the next afternoon together. After he went up to visit his step-dad and go fishing. He messaged me a few hours later saying that he might stay up to fish an extra day but hasn't decided yet. I asked if he could decide considering the circumstances as I am really messed up over this and he promised support. He never responded.   I need your help. This is the love of my life and it's falling apart in a brutal way. I understand his need for space but my heart is broken and I feel completely lost and betrayed by his actions. I asked if there was another solution to me moving out and his response was that he would move out (knowing full I don't make enough money to make that rent payment).",relationshipadvice

dzn1s83,8mcs6o,HelpfulCherry,"Again, this is only California that I know of, but at least here in CA if a landlord fails to both provide you with an itemized list or your deposit back within a certain amount of time, you're off the hook *entirely* and they are also subject to a penalty.   New York may or may not operate like that. I'm saying it's worth researching if it does, because if NY is like that then the OP can tell his previous landlord to pound sand and they can't give him a black mark for their failure to follow up.  I can understand the idea that he got moved to ""the top of the list"" but I would also argue that if a complex is so poorly managed that they let a debt slide for 7 months without so much as notifying the tenant that's on them. And we're also not talking about them suing OP for it, we're talking about how they never so much as provided any notice of the charges in the first place.",legaladvice

c1nrr46,giemc,,I agree with _UsUrPeR_. Too add onto the part where if she says she does not have any problems with crowds and open spaces; let her know how her actions make you feel. Try to explain to her how important this event is to you and that she is also important to you so you want her to be there. Confront her about how often she turns down your requests. Tell her excuses are not acceptable this time because of the importance of this event.  When she starts to say self deprecating comments tell her it's not alright to say those things. Ask her why she is belittling herself and ask her what she really thinks of herself. She may have very low self esteem and that's why she doesn't want to go to these events.   If she gets upset when you try to talk to her about all of this then ask her why she gets so upset. Would it be easier to not discuss it face to face? Is she afraid you might leave if you knew the truth? Lots of questions she needs to answer. Set an evening to talking and don't give up.

119rie,119rie,throwinaway9000,"So I started hanging out with a girl i knew over the summer.  we had some mutual interest in one another over the 3 years i have known her but never started anything until the summer break.   the first time we hung out, it lead to a pretty good night, conversation flowed and overall nothing really went wrong.  it all eventually lead to a make out sesh.  at this point, i figured she seemed into me.  so over the summer we hung out quite a bit.  we went to shows and watched movies together.  most of these times resulted in the same event from the first time.  This is where it gets confusing.  from time to time id text her asking if shed like to hangout.  i would usually get a yes, only to have her cancel or flake out later.  this happened a couple of times.  eventually she would tell me that she does not want to hangout anymore because shes going back to college out of state.  i replied wondering what we had exactly when we were hanging out.  she avoided the question by saying she saws us as more of friends.  Fast forward a couple weeks, i get a text from her basically saying she messed up and said hanging out with me is awesome.  We hung out the next day.  we talked about what she did and she said she just over analzed it.  that was the last we hungout before she went back to school.    the weekend before she goes back to college, i decided to man up and tell her how i felt, if it was not already obvious. I told her i liked her and was sad she would be going away.  she pretty much responded with the same feelings, but she does not live here the majority of the year because of school. She also said we will see how it goes over winter break .  she then texts back a couple hours after this conversayion ends with how we should take it further than what we are currently doing.  To clarify what she said, i asked what exactly she meant by that.  she replied saying anything i want do along with how she was really into me.  i asked when we could get together, when she says tomorrow, only to have her back out saying she was busy packing and getting ready to go back to college. since this has happened, i have been so unnsure of how she feels about me.  did i mess this all up by not advancing sexually?  About a week into college, she instant messages me saying she misses me.  this happened after i liked one of her facebook pictures. We eventually skype and have a 15 minute conversation basically just catching up.  we talk maybe every other week, sometimes once a week now. i usually start the conversations, but they dont get held for too long.  I feel like im bothering her.  I hold onto this belief until she facebooks me telling me to talk to her after i hadn't for two or three weeks, which resulted in the same short conversations as always then its back to the old mind set.    its hard for me to stay positive when things like this happen, but at the same time, i wonder if shes thinking the same thing i am?  Or if im just analyzing this thing too much when the answer is really simple? The only way she talks to me is if theres some silly reason to, like when i liked her picture.    Anyways, sorry for this long drawn out post, but i am pretty damn clueless here.  i could drive myself crazy thinking about it.    I sometimes get advice from a friend of mine who has known her longer than me. I explain pretty much what i said above and assures me, usually while laughing, that im good and I got it.

htp0d,htp0d,throwawaysugardaddy,"We've been together for nearly 4 years, and I've been happy for about 3.2 of those years.. We had been travelling and returned back to our normal life about 6 months ago.  We've both always been income earners, but when we returned she failed to get a job (we aren't in the US, it's actually pretty easy to get a job here).  So I've been paying for everything, her rent, her food, and a little bit of spending money(not much mind you). I didn't mind doing this because I care for her very much. The problem is it's been going on for 6 months... and in this time she has only gone to 1 interview, hasn't really tried since.  When she didn't get the job she took it fairly hard, so I talked to her about this and tried for a week to get her motivated and told her how good she is at what she does etc - but nothing came from it.  I bring up the topic every now and then, she'll cry whenever I do. I try to be a sympathetic ear and I've tried to get to the underlying root of all this but she goes silent and doesn't say anything (Normally I can coax whatever is bothering her out of her).  So now I feel like I'm being taken for a ride, what's worse is that her being in this country depends on me, defacto visa. I'm finding myself less and less attracted to her as a person - and if she says anything that's even a little self entitled I want to just say something...  I should also mention she has some 'money making schemes' (painting) but she's only done 3 (in 6 months) and hasn't gotten around to selling them - and a website which is going no where. I have been supportive of her with these projects.  I did the maths, for the money I've spent on her, I could've hired a mid-range hooker every week for 6 months, which would be considerably more sex than I'm getting, and probably better quality to boot.  I just don't get why she's taking me for a ride like this, I don't know what to do to try and solve this problem. I'm not even sure if I want to try anymore..

After the accident both parties pulled to the side of the road and exchanged information, though each disputed the others account of how the accident occurred. My wife claims the other party crossed a double yellow to enter a merging lane early and struck my wife as she legally entered the merging lane at its beginning, other party claims my wife merged into her.   Immediately after pulling over police were called. Prior to the police arriving, but after exchanging information, the other drivers boyfriend arrived and claimed my wife was trying to “scam” them and insisted they weren’t waiting for police and then drove off.   Police arrived a few moments later and gave a report # and took our side of the story down then left.   Was this technically “leaving the scene of the accident?” How is this likely to impact the inevitable disparity of stories told to the insurance companies?

l67qw,l67qw,throwthisshitaway091,"We just passed 4 years together, just started year 2 of living together. The thing I love most about him is that he's my best friend, he knows me as intimately as anyone ever has and usually knows what I'm thinking whether I say it or not. We can talk for hours without ever running out of things to say, and rarely (if ever) have arguments.   However, he demands a lot from me at the same time. Every time I pass him in the apartment, he has to hug/kiss me. If I'm sitting at my desk working on a project, he'll come up from behind me and kiss me once every 20 minutes or so. If I'm cooking, he'll stand behind me and wait for me to turn around so he can hug and kiss me. I know I shouldn't be complaining, but he touches me WAY too much in my opinion. I have talked to him about this in the past, but he always seems really hurt and then I don't mention it again for a while because then I feel bad.   The problem is that I feel he is cheapening our physical interactions. If I stand around all day hugging and kissing him in a non-sexual manner, it becomes difficult for me to associate those actions with sexytime. Plus, at some point I actually get annoyed with the hugging and kissing, making it all the more difficult to get aroused by it. I think he's starting to feel pushed away, because recently he started asking for kisses. ""Can I have a kiss?"" is probably the biggest turn-off for me. Or if I start kissing the dogs he'll say ""why don't I get any kisses?"" Come on.   Yet another issue is that he's stopped initiating sex, like at all. He just patiently waits until I'm in the mood and come to him for it. That in and of itself is a turnoff. (Because of the excessive kissing, his advances were often rejected due to the lack of turned-onness due to the excess of kissing, if I'm making sense at all. So he's basically given up and now leaves sexytime up to me.) So we're down to like 1-2 times a week (usually once. Twice on a good week), three weeks a month. Not too bad I guess, but he wants to have more and I want to WANT to have more.   I'm having trouble determining if I'm still attracted to him or not. I'd like to spend the rest of my life with him, but not if he keeps treating me like a precious fragile butterfly who'll die if she isn't told ""I love you"" thirty times a day and hugged and kissed til she screams. I can't believe I'm complaining about too much affection, but there it is. I honestly believe if he would ignore me and take me for granted a little I'd be way more into the sex.   I'm gearing up to have a discussion with him about all this, I just wanted to gain a little perspective and/or advice before doing so. Thanks in advance for any helpful tidbits you may have.  TL;DR My boyfriend hugs/kisses me to the point of annoyance and it's making me not want to have as much sex.",relationshipadvice

vdtky,vdtky,,"One night my girlfriend and I were hanging out at my house.  After laying down watching a movie, I fell asleep.  She woke me up and said she was leaving.  I let her out, went back to sleep and woke up to a ""good night"" text in the morning.  The next day I ask her how here night was and what she ending up doing after she left.  After a long pause she tells me she watched tv, finished some laundry and went to bed.  It seemed strange to me, but I let it go.  I brought it up later and told her that I was bothered about it and asked if she was being honest.  After a while of her being defensive she admits that she lied and that she actually went to see the new apartment of a guy friend.  I know the guy pretty well.  They're good friends and talk often but don't usually see each other very often.  I don't want to sound cocky or mean,  but he isn't the kind of guy that would seem like a threat.  She assured me that nothing happened that night or ever in the past and that she was only ever interested in him as a friend.  When I asked her why she lied about it she told me that she didn't want me to feel like she ditched me to go hang out with him.  I'm a pretty good judge of character, and she's a really decent person so this is kind of a shock to me.  I believe everything the said to me except that the reason for lying seems a little iffy to me.  Should I be concerned that she still isn't telling me the whole truth?  Should i continue to be trusting?  If it matters, her last boyfriend was very untrusting and jealous, but Do I need to be worried about our relationship?  For a little background, im 28m shes 21f.

We have a minor child together,  and three weeks ago I left home while we ""sorted things out"".  During that time she has had an affair with her apparent pot dealer, and she is currently under investigation for possesion of marijuana and paraphernalia.  As retaliation of being caught cheating and potential drug charges she has made false claims of abuse and I now have a restraining order against me.  Now about me.  Years ago I had an accident that required two surgeries and became addicted to pain killers.  I hear that's very common, something like 1 out of 5 struggle with this.

She ended up not getting a permanent position where she moved to so she moved back home and contacted me, she's sorry, the whole deal. Whatever.

He's also raped 3 girls and somehow is not in jail. There's more he's done too, but it's not relevant to this post.  Now, if I found out a person I was with had done these things, I would immediately cut contact and never look back. But she texts him basically all morning before work and all night after work.   What am I missing? If I try to bring it up, she gets extremely defensive and just says I'm being jealous and that she can be friends with whomever she wants.

We've agreed to see a therapist but she keeps resisting making an appointment until I assure her that ""we're on the same team"" and I'm fully committed to this relationship otherwise she won't waste her time (like an hour after four years is a waste).  In the last few a months a disturbing trend has come up where if she texts me and I don't reply (fallen asleep on couch watching a movie, been out drinking with friends, whatever) she will get a taxi to my apartment at any hour (midnight, 1am) and ring the buzzer until I answer.  Screaming, crying, throwing things will ensue after which I'll beg her to come to bed.  The next morning she'll have mellowed out and like an ass I will instigate sex and then we'll sort of try to move forward with the day.  She will hold me hostage on the phone.

It was only by threatening her that I would call the cops if she came did she back off.

We hadn't been seeing each other that long, but I could already tell things were going down hill. I caught her lying to me a few times, and she blew me off almost every night to go out with her friends. I'm not a controlling person, but when the most contact you've had with your girl is five minutes a week, and that happens more than once, I'm pretty sure it's time to move on.  Anyway, I ended up going to an ex's house that night. She heard what happened and we talked things over a few beers. Nothing happened, I know what some of you are thinking. But all last week we hung out. Eventually we started talking about us, and I told her before things got serious, I want to take it slow and move on from the last. I didn't want her to be a rebound cause I care about her too much to use her to get over someone else. She understood and even told me thanks for being honest and not doing that to her.  So anyway, my job called for me to be out of town for a few days the day after we had that talk, and ever since that things have been different. I got a hold of her when I got back and instead of seeing me she went out with some friends that night. I was cool with that, we're not together so I didn't expect her to be asking to see my right away. But today she invited me over to a mutual friends birthday. Everyone but me was drinking since I have to work tomorrow (and I'm still up, damn you Reddit). She barely acknowledged me. When I asked her what was up, she told me it was because she didn't know how to act. We couldn't be all over each other because we're not going that fast, and she said she didn't know how to act as just a friend to me so it was easier for her to let me do my thing with everyone else. But when I was leaving she asked to see me tomorrow and if she could possibly come over tonight. Obviously she's not over here, and I figured she drank enough to stay at her girlfriends place that the party was at.   I don't know what to do right now. I'll admit, I have some trust issues. It caused us to break up the first time and she told me if we were going to do it right this time, I couldn't act that way. I told her before I left that I wanted to talk about our situation tomorrow and I had a few things in mind. But now, I don't know what to say to her. I don't want to put boundaries on a relationship that isn't there, but I also don't want to have that happen again. I understand why she wasn't all over me, but at the same time I didn't like being kind of ignored by her. I don't want to rush things with her, but I don't want to lose her either. She's a great girl. If I made a list of ten things I'd want in a girl, she'd easily meet seven of them, and a good possibility more as I got to know her.  So, lovely rare ladies of Reddit(and anyone for that matter), any tips or ideas? Maybe suggestions of what we should talk about? Or maybe some advice like, I wouldn't worry about how she's acting right now because she is a little confused on how to act around you in your situation?   Also, I read the ""Don't let crazy put it's dick in you"" post. And while I don't think I'm crazy, not going to lie, reading it made me question myself.

1gs377,1gs377,,"Hello! First post here, but you all have given phenomenal advice to countless posts that have helped me in numerous ways. The advice I'm seeking is not necessarily for me as it is for my best friend and perhaps my own peace of mind. My best friend (I've known her since we were in preschool together) is married to one of my good friends from high school and he has always been a naturally flirty guy with the group of people we hang out with, sometimes to the point where someone has to remind him he's married (for 3 years now) and his wife might not appreciate what he's doing. Most times it's innocent conversation and a few meaningless touches, but lately it seems to be more intimate with a certain goal in mind and sure enough he just cheated on her with one of our good friends and nobody in our little group is doing anything about it. I'm pretty upset because she does so much for him and their sex life is spectacular which would give him absolutely no reason to do what he did. She is an amazing woman who puts others first (including their almost 3 year old daughter) and he clearly does not appreciate nor deserve her. He's a hard-working electrician, but has no motivation to help out with household chores, and she's an under appreciated teacher who has no idea what/who he just did. Sometimes, the main reason why I think they got married was because they had a child. Otherwise, I would not see them being together at all. I don't like to be confrontational, but I'm not sure if he'll understand his transgressions unless someone calls him out on it. I really want him to be a mature man about it and tell her what happened, but I don't know if it'll turn out that way. I'm asking for any advice about what to do as a ""3rd wheel"" in this situation. Thank you!  Tldr: best friend's husband just cheated on her with a good friend and nobody is doing anything about it and she (the wife) has no idea about what has transpired.",relationshipadvice

We are best friends and have always done everything together, but lately she has had no time for me. Reason being is she got into a new school (art school), and has completely immersed herself in this world. Obviously I admire her worth ethic, but I have several serious problems.She hardly ever responds to my texts throughout the day anymore. Sometimes I'll need a response right away, but she just doesnt respond. Another issue is that she is no longer able to talk on the phone anymore. We used to talk at the very least an hour every day, now im lucky to get in a ""just wanted to say i love you and good night"" every couple days. And finally the biggest issue is not being able to see her that often. I cant ever go over when shes home because I will ""distract"" her from her work, because she would just want to talk to me the whole time, and wouldnt get any work done.  Ive talked to her about how I don't believe that I will be THAT much of a distraction, and that she's over exaggerating it, but to no avail. It has not changed her thinking. This whole thing has even led her to question whether we should stay together or not. Reason being is that she feels it's unfair to me how little time shes able to dedicate to me. She also feels bad about the fact that she loves what shes doing so much that its detracting her from me.  Is she being reasonable? Does this happen often between people? Is she being genuine, or is something else going on here? I hate to doubt her at all, but with how long we've been together, its hard for me to believe that me ""distracting"" her while shes working is reason enough to cause a relationship this serious to end.

Finally junior year, after not seeing each other for a while she dated some guy for a few months. She turned to me after being unhappy in her relationship and we started dating pretty much immediately after she broke up with him. During the first few months of the relationship the sex was great. Once a day usually, sometimes more, and always satisfying. She says I'm the largest she has been with which is nice to hear. Then for what seemed like for no reason at all it slowed down. We have gone weeks at a time without sex.   Now I'm finishing up my final semester after she has graduated and I try to travel home every other week to see her. This last weekend was her birthday and we had a great time, I make a point of planning fun stuff for events like this. She said it was one of her favorite weekends we've spent together. However we didn't have sex, which brings us to around a month without it. It's not everything of course and I try not to press the issue but I can't help but think she has lost sexual interest in me.   Over the months we've both gained a bit of weight but nothing crazy. She's as attractive as ever and she tells me the same but I can't help but think that she's not as interested. We both live with our parents but there are certainly times and ways to still have sex but she makes no effort. When we are alone I try to initiate but she often refuses and says that she isn't in the mood, or is worried they might come home, or is too drunk, or too tired. I feel that we should seize whatever opportunity we have because we never know when the next time we can have sex will be. I don't understand how, after nearly a month of no sex, we aren't just all over each other at the first chance we get.  My question is should I take her lack of sexual interest as a sign of trouble?

I love my boyfriend very much, and I care a lot about his feelings, and our relationship (outside of a few little arguments here and there) is going great.  Here's the problem- I'm sort of crushing on one of my friends.  Here's the bigger problem- he lives in a different state, and we're friends through a MMO game. We talk on Skype for hours, every day, and I've known him for a little over a year, as well. I'm not sure if he likes me or not, but there have been subtle hints, here and there. He's gotten gifts for me, and has planned a few little surprises, which have meant a lot to me, and have been super unexpected, and welcome, considering my boyfriend is not really the kind of guy who goes out of his way to surprise me.  He's coming to my state to check out a college (which is really close to where I live), and to visit family, and of course, me. He'll be here for only a few days, and in that time, I'm going to see him.  I'd like to hang out a few times with him, without my boyfriend being around, and I don't want to necessarily sleep with this guy, but I want to find out how he will act around me without my boyfriend being around. Also, I sort of want to kiss him, but I am afraid that is an awful thing to do since I'm already in a relationship.  I know I have a lot more in common with the ""internet guy"" than I do with my actual boyfriend, whom I've still got a very strong and healthy bond with, and I would never want to do anything that would hurt him, but I'm afraid my curiosity is taking over.  Any suggestions/hints would be really appreciated, I'm in a tough situation. Like, is it worth the risk of potentially letting this other guy know my feelings, or should I just drop it and live my life as I already was?

1o4igs,1o4igs,,"This is actually a very serious problem for me and every bit of advice would be much appreciated! Sorry for the length... I'm bad for that.  So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 2.5 years. We currently live with one another and have been for about 1 year. She was brought up in a household where he dad was a rude and sometimes violent alcoholic, and since then her dad has 100% recovered and is a relatively decent guy now.  Since I've known my girlfriend, her crazy mother has psychologically abused her. She has threatened her with disowning her along with putting an end to the financial school aid she gets from her grandma and much more, all for leverage in arguments and in order to control her life choices. Her mother is also intensely religious and doesn't see eye to eye with anything, she's also way too stubborn to ever listen to reason in debates. But also, there are times, actually quite often, when her mom is very pleasant and just fine.  You should know that my girlfriend is an atheist and is not at all 'messed' up due to her past or anything of that nature. With the exception that she did have some serious lying issues throughout her life to avoid problems with her dad and mother. This carried over to all of her relationship including ours, where she has cheated on me with 5 other people in the course of a year, including a 3-4 month affair. Now you might be thinking, holy shit, ditch this broad!! But no, I am giving her a second chance (I found out about all of the cheating on one very messed up day). That being said, it's been over a year now since that, we have done everything together to help her combat her lying and cheating issues and I can now confidently say that she is trustworthy. Our relationship has become much stronger out of all that.  I thought it was important to mention that last bit because of this:  Last thanksgiving I spent the night at her parents house (they live in a different town) and because I was respecting her religious views, I slept in a different room than my girlfriend. I woke up to her rotten mother talking down to her in the living room, telling her she is doomed to fall in to a situation where alcohol takes over her life. How all children brought up in alcoholic homes turn out wrong and need serious counselling. Keep in mind that my girlfriend is completely unhindered by her growing up with the exception of that lying issue which we tackled hard and cured. Either way, her mom isn't used to being confronted as she is manipulative and unrelenting when it comes to getting her way. Her mom also has an obsession with 'respect' and throws around the word at everything, and she is never in a position to return any respect. So I stepped out of my room and walked straight up to her and let her have it, I seriously ripped her apart and made her realize how insanely she was talking to her daughter among many other things. I just had enough at that point.   Since that time, she never questioned me again or my girlfriend. Actually, she became a very sweet lady and stopped all of her BS for the most part. Wow, huh?   Until now. Fast-forward to the last couple of days, thanksgiving again. My girlfriend told her mom that I wasn't able to make it for thanksgiving because I have floor waxing plans, getting ready to launch a new business and because sleeping in a separate room was very unnatural and uncomfortable for me. So the problems started up again, crazy talk about respect and trying her best to brainwash my girlfriend.  Part of breaking my girlfriend's lying was for both of us to implement an open book policy, which was advised to us by practically every publication and book written in regards to our problems.  That being said, I my girlfriend and I read her mom's messages which were all negative in some way and directed at me. Some of the things she was saying were very immature and nonsensical.   So I afterwards I sent her mom a lengthy reply (she can't be spoken to) and talked to her about how I didn't appreciate the assumptions and accusations behind my back. Also told her to talk me directly if she has a problem, and we needed to both respect each other's interests to have a mutually successful and happy life.  She takes this info, and immediately starts strike two against me with my girlfriend. Trying to again manipulate her by removing her money, she called me controlling for reading her messages (irony), I have to mind my own business and show respect, she we're not common-law she was telling my girlfriend that I should be paying for everything (hello 1930s), amongst a bunch of other ridiculous things. Please note, for that last point, I am extremely generous with gifts, food and subsidizing all expenses dramatically for my girlfriend. So her saying that really bothered me.  Either way guys, I have to stop writing sometime. Christmas at her place is officially cancelled, my girlfriend is baffled by her ridiculous mom but is in a position where she is still dependant on them for her grandma's money. My girlfriend would never disown her own parents, which is something I definitely don't encourage. And there is NO WAY to reason with this lady and my girlfriend will be spending the weekend up with her parents. I can't imagine the amount of brainwashing and arguments that will ensue.   She will not listen to reason or logic, even though everyone disagrees with her. And she is single handedly causing a huge altercation within my relationship that I really don't have the time or patience for.  What should I do?  TLDR: Girlfriend's mom is crazy and unreasonable. She manipulates my girlfriend against me, or tries to (it never works). And now there is a large altercation with her for no reason other than her ridiculous desire to start conflict and get her way. I do my absolute best to avoid her at all cost and respect any concern she has when it comes to her religious beliefs. But she is unrelenting and her problems aren't getting any better. This has caused a situation of concern between my girlfriend and I, what should I do?

Unfortunately, due to the hectic nature of the yearbook-signing scramble, she did not actually have her book with her as it was circulating among other students. I didn't get  chance to sign her yearbook and she wasn't able to sign mine.  Midway during the Summer, we contacted eachother over Facebook and decided that we would mail eachother a letter containing what we had intended to sign. I sent a letter filled with the usual vomit - stuff about having spent too little time together and recounts of when we met. I also noted that I had a bit of a crush on her when we met in our sophomore year. After not getting a letter back from her for a few weeks, I decided that sharing that bit of information must have been a mistake and after a short while, I forgot that she was supposed to send me a letter.   A couple of weeks ago I 'liked' one of her statuses on Facebook.  She messaged me (as if my sudden presnece on Facebook jogged her memory) saying that we should meet so she could sign my yearbook. After I agreed, she noted that we should meet over lunch. I'm forced to wonder why she decided to bring the yearbook up over a year later.

c2pscxd,kyo96,itsathrowawayy,"I feel you, my man, I really do. I just recently got scolded by a lady friend of mine for showing way too much interest in her. She said she didn't want to deal with that at the time. She is an introvert, I’m an extrovert.  After having a couple weeks to think about it, there is some simple advice I came up with that at least makes sense to me: focus on yourself. You may perceive what you were doing as ""simply showing interest,"" but think about what made you attractive to her in the first place. She didn't like you because you showered her with attention, she liked you because of all the things you did before you met her. She didn't like some magical person that you became midway through getting to know her; she was happy to be with the person that she was meeting. So the last thing she wants is for you to fawn over her and show her constant attention. She wants to be with the person who has a god damned life, who has interesting shit that he likes to do without her.  So man up, be yourself, and know that while spending time with her is nice, while it may be one of the best feelings you get, it’s not gonna make you attractive to her. Keep working on you and she will have even more to be interested in.  It’s a simple fact: if she likes you, eventually she’ll show interest. It feels like shit when you keep putting in “effort” and don’t see any in return. It’s cause she doesn’t want to see you become a part of her, she wants to be with someone who is his own man.  Soo yeah, that was honestly more a message to myself then to you (I’ll probably save it for later), but it’s late, I want to go back to watching Breaking Bad, and I’m not going to edit this to be more relatable to your situation haha. Hope it helps though, from your post it seems like we are dealing with a lot of the same things.",relationshipadvice
ngl1l,ngl1l,,"I met this girl last year, as a freshman in college. We fell in Love, one thing led to another, and we ended up together. I would describe our relationship as perfect: we were never happier than when we were together, we lost our virginities together, we always dealt with problems before they could develop into fights, and we always treated each other right. For a couple our age, we were very serious. We never got engaged or did anything too naive, but we talked about our future a lot. Last week she broke up with me because she doesn't want a relationship at this point in her life, even though we're still in Love. She said she knows that if we stayed together, we'd end up married years from now, and that's a terrifying thought for her at this age. She felt trapped because of this. She grew up never believing she would settle down with one person, and her parents are divorced. When school starts up again, we plan to still hang out and interact, since we are still both the other's best friend. We both want to be together again when she's ready, and I will wait as long as I need to. More than anything, I want her to be happy. If that means that I have to do things that hurt me, I'm willing to. But I do honestly believe that the best thing for her is to come back to me one day. Unfortunately, I have a emotional stake in this situation. I don't know how much space to give her, what issues she needs to address alone versus what I can help her with, or how to handle this in general. I have ideas but I am aware of my bias and I want others to help me make sure I'm doing the right thing for her. I'm hoping that others here have experienced the same fear of the future and can help me help her. How can I help her learn and grow until she's ready for what we had again? More importantly, what do I do to make her happy now and in the future? TL;DR: A girl and I are in Love. She broke up with me because she isn't ready for our level of seriousness at this point in her life. We both want to be together in the future. How do I help her grow until she's ready? How can I make sure she's happy, even at the expense of my own happiness?",relationshipadvice

cm26tbo,2m9dqy,armchair_barratry,"&gt; You should know a hell of a lot before you file a lawsuit. Don't file a lawsuit until after your lawyer has talked to the other side's insurance company.  The lawyer will handle this and can properly advise OP as to if and when filing is the proper action. Obviously OP should not attempt to file a lawsuit pro se.  Not all decent lawyers agree to a sliding contingency fee. Some charge a flat third if it settles fairly early or if they fight it to the end of time. The question is not if they will settle, it's what they will settle for. That's what you're paying the lawyer for, not just to cash a check.  Charging more than 33% for a settlement with no filing would be excessive. But a flat 33% with or without is not necessarily at all excessive.

Things were not always great between us, he was kind of messed up, closed off, would be distant at times, and then would randomly really open up to me, but I was in love with him so I rolled with the punches (punches including him lying and cheating occasionally). Anyway, after 3 years of us being together, me being the absolute best gf I could be for him, being there for him through family problems, housing him when his parents kicked him out, etc., I went through some family difficulties and he was completely not there for me at all. It even got to a point where I was contemplating suicide. We broke up later in a really bad way (ended in abuse, cops,etc.) and I shortly after found out that he had been cheating on me pretty much the last year we were together, all through all my family issues. I still don't know how many girls, or when exactly, but after we broke up all the stories poured out of all of our mutual friends. This nearly ruined my life. But hey, it's been almost 2 years now, and I'm fine, it doesn't even make me sad to think of this anymore, I just kick myself for being so stupid.

I think this point is critical, but it seems there's a argument that media sites understand the pandemic nature of of mass killings. This can be seen in how the media has, largely, ceased to report on suicides -- they are well aware that their coverage can create copy cats, and yet they continue to cover mass shootings. Why? Because it helps their bottom line.  &gt;  &gt; Could you level essentially a class action suit against the media?  &gt;  &gt; But on the other hand, I'm no lawyer. It may well be the case that these arguments are easily dismissed or countered -- so I thought I'd ask the opinion of actual lawyers.      --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice
plp7z,plp7z,,"Hey, 14 year old male here, and I'm In a bit of a tough spot. So I've never really been much of a ladies man, but tinge are starting to come together now, a girl I met through an inter-county-commingling event my town does has been my girlfriend of 5 months, she goes to another school a while away and as a result I don't get to see her as much as I'd like. Over the past month or two we've been slowly growing apart and hanging out less and less, all her friends insist she still likes me. Then, i find out someone else at my school( who I liked about a year ago) really likes me :/ she (the new girl) seems like the one, smart musical artsy hipster type. Except I have no freaking idea what to do, should I end my old relationship, and embrace this new one or try and rekindle the fire in my old one. Time is swiftly running out. Again young kid here clueless about love. anything is appreciated  TL;DR: 5 month gf and I are drifting apart, not sure if I want to try and make things better with her, or embrace newfound hipster lover. time is running out.",relationshipadvice

c3nlksq,p9jvu,talashira,"You're right: you *were* inconsiderate, insensitive, and selfish. Your boyfriend is uncomfortable with a number of things that he has, by all accounts, a right to be uncomfortable with, even if you don't understand that discomfort... yet instead of supporting him, your view on things is, as you said, that he should ""just fucking deal with it."" That's awfully cold of you.  &gt; I tend to flirt with men. It's something I enjoy, and also a way I try to battle my own insecurities.  This is not something one does when in a relationship. If you have insecurities, battle them in a way that doesn't make the person to whom you're committed uncomfortable. Openly flirting with others is considered by many to be ""crossing the line.""  &gt; We saw a mutual friend, who we've recently had some tension about because my BF has seen me flirt with him and that bothers him. [...] Again, this night, I was flirting with the mutual friend, and the conversation ended up mostly revolving around sex.  You already know your boyfriend feels uncomfortable with you flirting with this guy, yet you throw it in his face by flirting *in front of him* and talking about *sex* with the guy? Where is your sense of boundaries? I wouldn't trust you much either after this. The show of disrespect is so outrageously obvious that it's certain to leave him wondering whether you have *any* respect for him or your relationship at all.  &gt; we had such a trusting and safe and wonderful relationship, and it feels like this one mistake I made is capable of destroying that.  Your boyfriend clearly does not feel this way. One mistake wouldn't do this to a long, steady, healthy, trusting relationship. He obviously feels that this has been an ongoing problem that you've been ignoring, and that this latest episode was just the final straw that broke the camel's back.  I personally think that you do not in any way appear to be equipped for a serious relationship with another human being. You're insecure, self-absorbed, and unable to put yourself in his shoes. But I'm not going to tell you to break up with him, as I'm sure others will (it seems to be the favored advice on this subreddit).  You need to tell him that you're very sorry that you hurt him, that you want to work with him to discover his boundaries and really understand where they are, and that you're willing to give him a little time to cool down before talking to you. Give him some space; he's hurting.  And you have *got* to figure out a way to understand that people's feelings matter just as much as yours, *even when you don't understand or agree with them. Especially* the feelings of your SO; ideally, their feelings should, at times, matter even more to you than your own.  Good luck.",relationshipadvice

fdup5,fdup5,,"I just ended relationship with the only girl I've loved that lasted ~2 years. I did this because mainly I found out that she let another guy kiss her the other night.  There's this really good friend of hers, lets say his name is Ryan. Her and Ryan sit together at lunch everyday (I'm not in HS anymore, but she's a year younger so she is) and talk and talk and talk. I know they text all the time, and a few months ago, Ryan confessed his undying love for my girlfriend. I asked my her if there was something going on, and she replied ""No, I could never date him, he's such a douchebag."" And I trusted her.  A few weeks ago she told Ryan to back off of her, and stop with the flirting and everything. They had a fight, but the next day things were right back to the way they were. I constantly told her how I didn't like it, but I wasn't going to flat out tell her that I didn't want her to talk to him, I don't want to be an asshole, y'know?  And then last night we were texting, and she told me that she was going to the store to get some food, no big deal or anything. And when she got home, we skyped and she was all smiley and I said, ""What's up?"" and she told me she was in a great mood and wouldn't explain why, just that she had a good day.  Then yesterday we go out to lunch, she tells me that I don't need to worry about Ryan anymore, that it's done, and I'm like okay. I just start asking questions (not seriously, just giving her a hard time) about their whole thing and I said ""have you kissed him?"" Then it was silent. My heart dropped. She said, ""He kissed me. Last night when I went to the store."" I didn't know what to do, I ran to the bathroom and felt like I was going to puke. Eventually I came back out, we didn't talk for about 15 minutes and I asked her to sit down. I told her I wanted to know what happened. She told me that it was all him, and that she pushed him away. It took me about an hour, but I got over it, and thought, ""Okay, it's not her fault, she didn't do anything, she said she doesn't want to talk to him anymore, so I'm happy to just roll it up and put it in the past.""  Fastforward 3 hours later. I get a message from Ryan. It says ""I need to tell you something.""  I told my girlfriend, ""I just got a message from Ryan.""  She said, ""I know what he's going to tell you.""  ""What?""  ""That he didn't force me to kiss him....""  I felt a hole in my chest. I didn't have any words, I just closed my laptop, and paced around my room, my heart beating faster than it ever has, my vision a blur...  I talk to my mom, my brother, and another friend on the phone for about 4 hours, crying my eyes out, not understanding why. I got a message from her saying that she did like him, and that she was just trying something new and about how much she loves me.  The only thing I could think was ""if you love me so much, why would you do it?"" She's told me so many times that she would never cheat, and I've told me many times that the only way I see myself breaking up with her is if she cheated. She sent another message saying ""I knew I was leading him on and I knew I let it go too far.""  She knew what she was doing - the entire time - and she knew I didn't like it because we've talked about it before.  I talked on the phone to friends/family like I said, and I continually told them that for some reason I feel bad. I feel like an asshole, and everyone kept telling that I did nothing wrong. I just feel so bad to make her cry, I haven't even thought about how much pain I'm in. They told me I should wait until the next day to make a decision, and I did.  I called her. And I told her that I know I'll never be able to trust her again, or love her the same way again. She just kept begging me, sobbing, saying, ""Please, please don't..."" for about 20 minutes until I finally got the balls to hang up.  Then, I learn that all her friends knew about the whole thing, and they didn't want to tell me because they didn't want us to break up. That made me feel even worse, all these people keeping such a big secret from me...  And I still feel bad.  I get a text saying, ""Don't do this to her, I've never seen someone in so much pain.""  I can't help but think, ""Don't do this to her? What did I do? I didn't do anything! Why are you making it seem like it's my fault?""  I've done everything for this girl. I walked down to her school everyday for a year to see her, anytime she had a bad day I'd go out and buy her a candybar or make her something nice, I did everything you could possibly imagine a nice guy could, and this is what I get in return. And when I asked her why? ""I don't know. I don't know."" over and over.  And I still feel bad. Everyone's telling me I did nothing wrong. I tried my best with her, I really did, I gave it my fucking all. I truly, truly love her, but I know myself, and I know that I could never look at her the same way again or trust her again.  So, I'm asking you guys, why do I feel so terrible? Why am I filled with regret when I shouldn't be? Am I too compassionate?  I'm so scared of being alone, it took the biggest balls I had to call her and end it. I feel so sick to my stomach, I'm on the verge of throwing up and I've barely slept.

At first I was worried about him than jeep, but as I was just about to ask for the information on who was the driver, etc., he wasn't finished with the story at this point.   He said he was so shocked and shaken by the accident he abandoned my jeep, running straight home, which he lives just around the corner. He hasn't told anyone about what happened, and couldn't even take the day off from work since he can't afford it.  I feel like something is not right with the story, as much as I wanna believe him, since I known him for years and trusted him with my jeep, but I feel like everything isn't told here since he didn't even call me the night the accident happened. I know he has no record of being arrested or going to jail, since we had to check our background records to maybe move into apartment together, but now all of that is on hold.    So now I have no idea on what I should do next as to call my insurance company or the police office to figure out what exactly happened, who hit my car, even if my jeep is still able to run, etc. Lucky I have my other car I been using, but I really want my jeep back.",legaladvice

The inhabitants were shipped off to the nursing home and was being sold by their daughter who didn't live in the house. So she had a paper that said something along the lines of ""I don't have to disclose anything because I don't live here"".   During the inspection there was some water damage on the ceiling but it looked old. The inspection was done in winter and we couldn't see much of the roof but what we could see looked good. Now that it's summer the shingles look good and new but the roof has bows and leaks EVERYWHERE! It's obvious that whoever did the roof did an extremely poor job and it just needs to be completely replaced. We were planning on replacing it a few years down the line, because we prefer tin to shingle, but it to happen this year when we don't have the time or money to do this ourselves.   Even though the daughter didn't live in the house she lived next door and took care of her parents, so she was in the house often and would, most likely, have known about the leaks. Do we have any legal recourse against these people?

And if the owners of Boulder Dash have the legal manpower (or means to afford it), you could end up royally screwed before ever coming close to a ruling. Granted, Boulder Dash is not a game I've heard of in decades, and if it's their biggest IP, I wouldn't imagine they'd have the biggest law army.  So while you could win based on what you have, the whole process could be quite financially consuming. If Japes were more varied from Dash, there'd be no chance of it going to court, but at this point it looks similar enough to where a judge would hear it, and thus the costs would begin stacking up.

The girl I am currently dating will not enter a full-relationship with me and understandably so.  She works full time and goes to school full-time and I am leaving for 6 months in May.  She almost left me once because of these circumstances, but I told her that I cared for her deeply and would be willing to work through these small hardships if she was.   I am a terribly nice guy at the same time I refuse to let anyone walk all over me.   Last night was the second Saturday in a row she was supposed to sleep over, came over to my house and then had to leave because one of her friends needed help.  Last week it was because her friend was having guy problems and this week her other friend got stranded on the freeway because she got drunk at some supercross event and put diesel in her car.   And to give you a deeper appreciation of the situation.  Friday night, when we were on a date we were forced to leave early because her friend [ the same one from the first saturday]  got extremely drunk and started puking at a party she went to alone.  So, she and I drove to get her, I drove her car and she drove her friends car back to their homes.   Back to the problem at hand. At first my extreme-insecurity and paranoia led me to believe that she just didn't want to spend the night with me [although she has before]. At the moment I didn't get angry or upset because I understood that she was already stressed enough having to baby-sit her friends and shoulder all their problems.   I don't have any sense of entitlement, but it seems to me that she might in light of all my efforts for this relationship, condescend to give me a night with her without having her friends interrupt us! Anyway I tried keeping calm this morning but I couldn't and so when she started texting me, I very nicely called some of her ideas stupid and started an argument.  That is my problem.   Whenever I get angry or upset I keep calm in the moment and then later my repressed anger comes up and manifests itself in the form of an argument.

We met a few years ago because we had the same group of friends, and soon after we became close friends. At the time I was of stupidly oblivious to the fact that she had an interest in me, so we remanded friends for a while. But after enough time I realized that I also had an interest in her, so we end up dating for a while and obviously were both very happy. But after some time I made the stupid decision to break up with her for some reason I can't even remember. So basically I broke her heart, even though I still had strong feelings for her. Fast forward a bit and I talk to her again (in the time past I hurt her by doing stupid things many times, most of which I didn't even realize until now). After talking for a bit she gives me another chance which I gladly take and I try to keep the relationship as perfect as possible. But something wasnt the same about her, I couldent tell just what but there was defiantly something. One day I was having a casual talk with her and she breaks up with me, which was a bit of surprise. Especially science the way she said it was, ""I love you but you but you don't deserve a drug addict girl like me."" now I neglected to mention that the both of us smoke pot, drink, and when the chance comes we may do harder substances. But neither of us are anything near drug addicts, which is what I thought was strange.  And now here we are, it's been a few months since we broke up, but seeing as I still love her I have been tryin to get her back and keep talking to her. But ever since we broke up she has Ben in a depressive slump. If I'm so lucky as to talk to her it usually ends in her saying that she does love me, so that's kind of good.   But the main reason I'm here is because I spoke to a good friend of hers about the matter. and she insisted that my girl was finished with me, which contradicts what my girl directly tells me (like I mentioned earlier, she still does love me or at least she says she does).   Her friend also says that I am the reason she is depressed. In her words, I ""played with her feelings.""

Enjoy life, take it slow, worldly vacations belong during school breaks and after college. Slow down, enjoy the ride, I sure did with my girl, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. When (if, only 45% of premeds in US are accepted) she gets into medschool then you will see real time management problems.

But she's (I'm guessing) young and still trying to analyse her feelings in this relationship. She's confused about her own feelings -- she doesn't quite feel as into this guy as he is into her, and she's over-thinking why... she's hit on the ""I don't have any feelings at all"" as a possible explanation, but it's BS.

Do you know why you don't let women you barely know move in with you and start up a relationship with them?  Because there's something wrong with a person who would want to move in with someone so soon.  So, don't let a mistake like that happen again.  There's a reason most people wait a year or two before they move in with someone, and what you're going through right now is what the reason is. 2.  She's the one who cheated, not you.  She's the one who walked out, not you.  Don't worry about her personal financial life.  If she wasn't concerned enough about your emotional health to spare you what you're going through right now, then you don't need to worry about her being strapped for cash.  If Mr. Volleyball teacher wants to steal your girlfriend from you and she's willing to let him, then let Mr. Volleyball pony up half the rent.  Otherwise you're going to come in and help her out for financial reasons, and then when she moves in with Volleyball man all her business will be in order?

Saying he was going to explain to me when we hung out, he never did.   Well. A couple days after the fact. It was like this light switch just turned off. We had made plans to hang out and he ended up putting our plans on hold so he could go beer tasting. I ended up falling asleep before he came back to town and he got rather irritated with me. I saw nothing wrong, he kept me waiting. And I don't wait for a man to finish his beer and put me on hold in the mean time. After I told him I fell asleep, I asked him if he would like to go to a special club night that night. He said no because he wants to hang out with his friends. It made me a little sad, but the sadness was short and that's when the light switch turned off. Didn't care to see him anymore, don't care to talk to him, nothing. I just don't emotionally care anymore. Later that night he had (apparently) called me several times and texted me trying to let me know that he left the club with his friends early. I had not planned on seeing him they night after all, so I was paying no attention to my phone. He also got pretty upset that I wouldn't answer my phone, especially cause he left early...without telling me he would. So ya, light switch. Don't care, I don't feel empathetic that he is angry or bummed.   Here's what's hard for me. Right now I identify as bisexual but am starting to realize I just prefer womyn. With men it's been so hard to fall for one and so easy to get back up. With womyn it's completely different and always with a stronger feeling. I enjoy a mans company, /sometimes/ the sex is enjoyable, but there's never a great connection.  I know this guy is into me. I can't lead him on. I can't live a lie, but I'm not ready to identify as strictly interested in womyn..even tho I am. And I don't want to tell him. So..what do I tell him? At the beginning of our dating period he told me he would be ok with me seeing other womyn and whatnot, but it's still not enough to satisfy me. I don't know how to break it off with him without revealing something that he could possibly argue with because I did sleep with him, spread my business around, etc...or lie to him...or ignore him.   I don't know what to do, but this is surely looming over my head.   Advice?",relationshipadvice

So on the first date we are at my place, and obviously she wants to make out - I should have stopped it here, but I didn't. Next thing you know we've had sex - and she ends up staying the night.  Just so you know, this whole thing is a result of my complete and utter cowardice.  On Sunday I get home from work and I get a phone call from the girl. She wanted to hang out ""immediately"" - and because I'm a complete pushover I said yes. My weakness in all of this is that I am a great actor, and she thinks that I am just as into it as she is.

Though, in the off chance that the report does not mention stopping, can I have it thrown out because the law necessitates stopping as the mechanism by which it is violated?

316vpi,316vpi,throwaway99tenant,"I'll try to be as concise as I can but this may turn into a long story, so apologies for that.  I've been living in my current rented flat for 8 months on a 12 month contract. When we first moved in, the flat obviously hadn't been touched by the landlord or the agency (various things needed repairing), it had only been cleaned but even then we weren't happy with the cleaning job. My housemate found a large pile of toenail clippings underneath his bed, there were hairs all over the bathroom, black mould around the sealant in the bathrooms and half of the ceiling lights were out, the paint above my shower was peeling away and none of the rooms had been painted prior to our move in date (multiple scuffs and stains on the walls).  Anyway, the day after we moved in and upon discovering these things we let the estate agents know we weren't happy with the cleaning, specifically the bathrooms, and overall state of the place but we agreed to clean it again ourselves to save the expense of someone coming out again (I did this over the phone, but I had an email from the estate agent confirming that I would be re cleaning the flat ourselves). I also remember going out and buying MOULD and mildew remover to try and tackle the black mould in the bathroom (I'll get to that later).  We also asked if they could replace the ceiling lights in the kitchen, the flat has very high ceilings so it was impossible to reach ourselves and we didn't have ladders (also assumed that this should've be taken care of before we moved in). I have an email confirming that someone would be over sometime during that week to replace the lights but it never materialised. We ended up forgetting about it, some of the lights did work but it wasn't hindering us using the kitchen as it was open plan. The agency took photos of the flat before we moved in and put them in the inventory as reference, (they were very small, but I assumed they had the originals on a hard drive somewhere) which documented the damage that was already there. I went through the flat noting down the obvious damage in the rooms already on the inventory (even counted the number of holes in the walls) but although I was thorough, I assumed that the photos would speak for themselves and I thought mould was something to do with cleaning so didn't write anything down about it as I didn't see it as ""damage"". (ugh!) This was my first mistake.  ANYWAY, fast forward to a few weeks ago. We'd never met my landlord before, but he phoned up one Saturday and said he'd be in the area so wanted to come and do an inspection on the flat the next day. We said yes, and he came over, but I didn't do a thorough clean of the place and admittedly, I hadn't given the shower/bath a good scrub in quite a while so the mould had built up a bit. I asked him if there was anything in particular he was looking for, and he said ""mould and damp mainly because you're in a ground floor flat"". He did the inspection and went home. The next day I received an email saying he wasn't happy with the state of the bathrooms and would need someone to come in and regrout and reseal the entire thing because of the black mould that was now present around the sealant of the bath and was ""beyond a simple cleaning job"". He would also be charging us to have the lights replaced in the kitchen (the last one had gone out a few days before his inspection) because apparently thats ""our responsibility"" but he kindly agreed to send someone out to do it for us, at our expense.  Back up a second, didn't I mention that the black mould was present on the day we moved in and I'd even gone out and bought mould and mildew remover to try and tackle the mould? And the lights hadn't been replaced before we moved in?  He also tried to accuse me of damaging one of the halogen light fittings in the bathroom, as it was hanging from the ceiling. He said I'd have to get someone out to repair it before we moved out or I'd be charged accordingly. After looking through the inventory I could just see on one of the tiny photos that the fitting was liked that when we moved in, which leads me to believe that the landlord didn't have a clue what sort of state the flat was in from the previous tenants. It was as if the previous tenants had moved out, they'd cleaned the flat then just left it and carried out absolutely no repairs and now we're getting the blame for it.  Now for the mould in the bathroom, I tried to explain to the landlord that this has obviously been an issue since before we moved in so it was unfair to pin the blame on us, as I don't think black mould could've grown and gotten that bad from the 8 months we were living there. That evening I gave the shower/bath a good scrub and most of it came off and looked just the same as it did when we moved in. I had a look at the inventory to try and compare but because the images are only about 2cmx3cm and printed on office paper, it's impossible to see any proper details of mould damage on those photos even though I KNOW its there, very faintly. Frustrating. He emailed back and said that the problem has gotten ""significantly worse"" as he ""can't see the presence of mould in the inventory photos"" even though you can very faintly see some black marks on the sealant.  He sent someone round from the agency to have a look at the mould and the guy said it was ""just a simple sealant job"". The landlord emailed me the other day saying that it would cost upwards of £500, where we would be charged at least £300.  I emailed the estate agent asking them to send me the high resolution files of the images in the inventory so I can zoom in, take my own photos and send the landlord comparisons because I'm 99% sure that the mould hasn't got significantly worse since we moved in, but I need larger photos to prove it. But they replied with ""you didn't send us any photos of the flat when you moved in. Our photos are printed larger in the back of the inventory"" (yeah, about 4cm by 5cm and printed on office paper which is still impossibly small and hard to see!). I've emailed asking for the large files again and still waiting for a reply. What if they don't have the full size images? They can't expect us to go off the crappy ones in the inventory can they?  Now my question is, do we have a leg to stand on here? Is it fair for us to be charged to have the whole bathroom regrouted and resealed even though the place hadn't been touched before we moved in and it was obviously an underlying problem? I'm just so frustrated with the whole thing. He's also trying to charge us for the cost of repainting the hallway because it has ""deteriorated"", even though we've added 2 or 3 surface marks at best and it wasn't painted before we moved in. I've never lived in a flat where mould has grown in the bathroom after living there for 8 months.  Any help would massively be appreciated.

fyhlz,fyhlz,,"Hi all,     This is my first post, so I'm not sure how this is supposed to work exactly, but I feel like I have nowhere else to turn. I invested so much into this relationship, to the point where I started to drift away from my friends. So I guess I'll start with a little back-story:           We'd been seeing each other for almost two years (started as just sex) dating for a little over one. This whole time we've been together with no ""interruptions"" (As in we've been ""together"" this whole time, and she said she had never cheated and had only been with me). Both summers since we started seeing each other, she'd go to a religious youth camp, where she'd be basically a ""camp counselor"" in the traditional sense. I supported her in this, I even donated money and brought my friends to her fundraising event, and they donated money too. So I would only see her very scarcely while she was at this camp, I even drove out there to see her twice (3+ hour drive each way). Prior to dating me she was pretty promiscuous, but she said that was all behind her now. I've always been relatively stable, a one girl at a time type of guy. I've never had a one night stand or anything remotely related to that. I've been with 3 women my entire life.           Fast forward to now, a few months ago shit just started falling apart. I was doing my best, I did everything she wanted. She wanted more space and didn't like it when I texted her, so I stopped texting. She didn't want to talk on the phone so I stopped calling. She didn't want to have sex so I didn't push for it. Stuff like that. All the while I'm doing the best I possibly could to hold everything together. She has by no means an easy life, she has lots of personal issues that are way more difficult than anything I have had to handle, but I did my best to support her through all those hard times too. She tried to end it two weeks ago, she overreacted to something I did, and said she didn't know what she wanted anymore. That killed me. I was destroyed. I stayed with her and kept trying to make things work, but she did it again two days ago, so I sat and thought about it for a while (I was emotional at this point), then I got up and took her key off of my key ring, put it on her desk and said ""I love you. I will wait until you know what you want."" I then left her house, wept in my car for five minutes, and drove home.           I spent most of Yesterday and the day before feeling sorry for myself and being overly emotional, as I am want to do. I wrote her an e-mail asking for her to tell me what she wants as soon as possible, for closure (Also wrote about how I felt, which was probably a mistake). This morning I found out she left her Gmail logged in on my computer. I am not a strong man. From reading her e-mails, it became plain that she was having at least an emotional affair (probably physical as well though) with a boy from her camp, while she was at the camp, and a long-distance-Skype-fueled-whatever with him while she was with me. In her e-mails she told this boy that she was “heart-broken” over me still, and she couldn’t do a long-distance relationship, four months **before** we broke up, while everything was still “happy” in my opinion.  But the e-mails continued after that point. I am shattered. I never even considered this as a possibility. I trusted her completely. Initially I felt like she was the only other person on my team, and so when she left me it was like she was just leaving me alone on my team. But now it feels like I had never had anyone on my team to begin with, like the last two years of my life had just been a giant joke, with me at the butt. So again, I am not a strong man. I wrote her another e-mail, confronting her about the extraneous relationship. She has yet to read either of these e-mails.           What do I do? I feel completely lost. I don’t think he knew that she and I were together while she was with him. Should I tell him? We were having unprotected sex for the last six months, should I get an STD test? How do I confront her? Should I confront her? I’m using what little will-power I have left by not texting all her friends asking for information and telling them about it, if they didn’t already know.

I really don't care as long as they were all before me. We agreed we weren't actually gonna give numbers out. Really I'm pretty sure she's slept with more people than I have and didn't want her to feel bad about herself.  Then she asks me whether or not she has ever ran into any of the girls I've been with. I tell her no and I'm certain of it. That question actually sparked my curiosity and I asked her the same question. She said I know one of them. She told me who and that it was 3 weeks before we started dating and she did it to get over a guy.   Well here's the problem. She told me this guy was a virgin a long time ago when they were hanging out a lot as ""best friends"". So I asked her about that and she said he was a virgin before she slept with him.  Ok so that's the lie. That's it. But they used to be best friends throughout our first few months of dating. It was obvious he was into her and I told her that and she said she would never sleep with him. ""He's like a brother,"" she said.  So now that lie is eating away at me.   ""If she lied about that what else did she lie about?"" I keep asking myself.  Right now I have so many scenarios running through my mind and I can't even fall asleep. I feel like that is close to as bad as cheating and that she could be hiding more.  I'm really trying hard to decide whether or not I should try to get over it so I can start trusting her again or if I should call it quits right now.

1q20lo,1q20lo,,"I recently started going out with this girl from my work. We've liked each other for a good amount of time but finally hooked up at a party.  After hooking up, I asked her out and she said yes. I have a bit of a problem now though and it's frustrating the hell out of me. Every time I ask her if she'd like to go out to dinner or the cinema, she says she will go and then backs out. For example, I live in England and it was bonfire night yesterday- I asked if she'd like to go and she said its too wet. I asked her if she'd like to go the cinema tomorrow as a compromise, she said she's in college even though I was planning to take her out at night anyways - college finishes at like 5 max.  Anyway, what I'm looking for advice on is why is she acting like this. Why make an effort to make it look like she likes me and then when we actually hooks up with me, she plays hard to get. I mean we talk to each other and that but she never seems to want to go out anywhere or never makes suggestions about what we could do together. How should I approach the situation now? Should I back off and stop asking her to go out? (As a side note, I've asked her to come out 2 times in the past few weeks) - I haven't showed signs that I'm desperate. I'd just like to go out with her because I really like her. The whole situation is just confusing me.  Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks.",relationshipadvice

e3bzriy,93b46j,Qwerty_Resident,"Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, but I have a decent amount of knowledge about recording stuff;  Generally speaking, the recording laws come into effect in places you have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It's iffy whether someone else's car (which is driving around in public) qualifies.  But assuming that it does, typically language that solves that is along the lines of ""Everything in this car is recorded for safety purposes, by riding in this car you are consenting to being recorded for the duration of your ride"". And even that might be more verbose than you actually need, but I believe in being thorough. If they are uncomfortable, they are free to not consent and not ride in your car.  I read [here](https://qz.com/985832/uber-drivers-are-filming-their-riders-with-dash-cams-to-protect-against-bad-reviews-and-false-accusations/) that Uber actively suggests using cameras in your car, so I don't think they'll give you trouble for it.  Also, a bit of other advice: be really careful about ridesharing; it changes your car from a personal vehicle to a work vehicle and if you don't tell your insurance company that you're using the car as a rideshare car, and you have a collision, you may find yourself without insurance coverage (We used to get a lot of these questions here, but maybe Uber/Lyft have gotten better about warning people to update their coverage?

I'm not interested in that happening, and think it's only going to end poorly.  After the bar, we ended up cuddling elsewhere, and the subject of the two of us being together came up. I said I had feelings for her, and that I wish she weren't moving away, but that what I described above would be too difficult. She seemed to want to do it anyway, which I was afraid would happen. She's sort of a hopeless romantic. I told her I was really sorry, we said goodbye, and she left crying.  I feel awful. We've spent the last few months being super friendly, flirting once in a while. That combined with some of the things I said after the bar makes me feel like I raised her hopes only to dash them. And she did seem seriously upset.  Now I'm at a loss for what to do, which is really what I'd like to hear about. This is new territory for me. A relationship is out of the question. We haven't talked in 24 hours. Should I wait before I try to interact with her again? I had plans to go out with her and some other people next weekend. Do I show up? Do I give her space? I'm really afraid that with the current situation, it would be too easy for us to just stop talking to each other until she moves away, which is absolutely not what I want.",relationshipadvice

lz4gl,lz4gl,,"Hey r/relationshipadvice-   Before I start venting, let me give you a little backstory. My girlfriend and I met two years ago, and have been living with eachother *fulltime* since then. We moved into a place of our own 3 months ago, and things have slowly been sliding down into an impenetrable black depth. We both love each other very much, but I've been feeling increasingly distant, uncommunicative, and cold towards the relationship. I just don't feel the spark anymore, and it seems like the only thing my girlfriend wants to talk about is: what i've done wrong, what she's annoyed with, what cleaning needs to be done, how i haven't given her enough attention, what friends of hers i'm trying to sleep with... I know I should communicate much more than I do, but in all honesty I'm at a point that I just want to be by myself and not have to put up with her shit.    Take this circumstance for instance: She has a Halloween/bday party on Halloween, which I'm fine with for the most part, except the fact that she didn't really ask me if I wanted to have one. So she has about 10 girls come over, the only guys being the boyfriends of her girlfriends. So we're sitting in the living room, her on the couch, me on the floor between her legs. I must have said something, but gf starts granny pinching me- and in retaliation I try to pull her by the legs off of the couch, which wouldn't have been a big deal if she wasn't wearing a skirt.. Yeah, I know, dumb idea- but in the heat of the moment you don't really think about embarrassing someone, least of all your girlfriend. After this she pushes me into the kitchen angrily and bites the everliving *shit* out of my cheek.   Okay, so I was a little annoyed before, but now I'm **pissed**- so I storm downstairs and walk out of the basement so no one will know I'm not around. She follows me, telling me she's going to call the cops on me, and, after a moment, I cool down enough to go back inside (it was really cold outside anyways). She starts crying and sobbing because her face paint is all mussied up now, telling me that I ruined her party and that she can't look any of her friends in the face again.   I tell her everything is all right, wipe the facepaint off, and we walk around from the basement to the front door, acting like we had just gone on a walk. We go upstairs so she can change and get the rest of the makeup off, and we start talking. We've been talking about adding a third person to our sexual endeavors, and she had invited a friend over who I thought she was trying to persuade for such a thing.   ""Hey your friend from class is pretty cute, are you trying to get in her pants? Because I'd like a part of that..""   *Laughing* ""Ohhh no, she's *mine*""   Drunk/horny me obviously responds ""Challenge Accepted""- which turned out to be a horrible, horrible, idea.   I sit next to her friend on the couch, while continuing to participate with the rest of the conversation. It was a little chilly in our house, so I throw my jacket over my lap and friends feet. Suddenly, girlfriend goes upstairs, and I follow. She accuses me of hitting on her friend, and wont listen to my reasoning at all, so I decide to stop talking to her. I slept on the floor that night because we had people sleeping over and didn't want them to know we had fought.   We haven't really spoken since, but lets just go ahead and make it clear that she has accused me multiple times of trying to hook up with a mutual friend. This time was the only time that I actually was, but it was a misunderstanding.   Anyways, she finally says something to me today to the effect of ""I'm going out of town for the weekend, and when I get back I don't want you to be here."" This is right after I bought her a 100$ Kindle and case, which for me is quite a lot since I'm a struggling college student.   Blah, augh, phooey! Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear some advice soon.    **TL;DR Not sure if this relationship thing is working out with this person.

4vqzy9,4vqzy9,Throwitaway1320,"Hello Reddit,   &amp;nbsp;  Location: East Houston (Highlands, TX area)  &amp;nbsp;  Recently the pipeline behind my house ( not on my property ) has started flaring propane out of a pipe that is supposed to be repaired. In order for them to repair the pipe they need to release/burn the product. I found this out by talking to the few workers that were on location. There was only 3 around when I was there. The worker mentioned that the amount of product they have to burn could provide my city with gas for a year. I'm not familiar with all the chemicals and what not that could be floating our way if any during this process. Everyone in this house has had a headache since they started, not sure if it's the chemical or the noise OR BOTH!   &amp;nbsp;  With that being said this flare is HUGE. I'd say the flame is about 20-30 feet in the air and it's so loud. It's been going on for 48 hours now. I'd reckon my house is about 350ft away from this flare. When I step outside I can feel the heat. Not to mention the loud high pitched noise this thing is making all day and all night. I'm currently working from home so I'm having to hear this constantly. At night the sleep isn't happening without some sleeping pills and my families anxiety has risen. The children think it's going to blow, my wife is paranoid and to be honest I'm not happy either. I understand it could sound hypocritical because we know we live by this pipeline but it's underground and it's not something that keeps us up at night and makes us feel uncomfortable like this flare has.    &amp;nbsp;  They didn't notify us at all. The workers said they notified the fire department and it's at the fire departments discretion if they want to notify us or not.   &amp;nbsp;  My family and friends have told me to sue them but I've never done this and have no experience with doing such thing.   &amp;nbsp;  If I was to attempt to do this, what would be your advice? I don't know where to start or if I should even start.

1t5muc,1t5muc,,"So when my wife and I were dating she was a smoker, which I was fine with even if I didn't agree with it. She tried to quit a few times with no success. When we got engaged however, she said she would quit for us. She did quit. She did really good except for the occasional when hanging with a smoker friend.   Now a couple years later and she smokes all the time. Not sure if it's a pack a day or not but it's close. We had a pretty rough year with some family deaths and troubles, and this led to her smoking again. I was understanding at first but with the amount now I am not. She keeps saying she'll quit and she doesn't. This past week she said she was really trying. Went a couple days without a single cigarette. Then she said she had one and it was gross. So I was thinking oh good maybe this will be it. But now I find an empty pack on the top of the trash and she smoked three times in front of me today. Then she wonders why I seem upset.   Am I being unreasonable? I know quitting smoking is hard but each time I feel like I'm being betrayed. Especially that she said she would quit for us when we got engaged.

mfsey,mfsey,,"Hey, if you're reading this, then I'd like to start off with a thank you, and ask for your advice on a situation that's currently troubling me. Though, to fully explain myself, I probably need to start my story a little over two and a half years ago, when it all began.  I live in the UK, and regularly attend the London MCM Expo in May and October. I'll be honest, it's the only time I get to see most of my friends, though I see a few outside of it too, though, this probably is rather irrelevant. It was May Expo 2009 where my story begins.  It was here that I met a young girl (and by young, I mean she was 16, I was 18). She was with a friend of hers, and speaking to the group of people I was staying with, so in the spirit of expo, I hugged them. It's what happens there. :) Her first words to me were ""You give nice hugs"", and that seemed like a huge ice breaker. Normally I'm really withheld when talking to people, but in this case, I was able to talk normally, and without many of my usual fears.   Anyway, as an enlarged group, we all headed back to the hotel, and changed out of cosplay, and got food. We'd split into smaller groups here, 4 or 5 to a table. She and her friend were at the same table as me and bro, and we continued talking. She showed us some of her drawings, and they were really quite something. It was getting onto evening now, and she said she was cold. I let her use old red, since it was all I had with me. Old Red is a red jacket I have that's been through the years. Two fairly accurate descriptions people have given it are ""it's like your comfort blanket"", which it is, and ""it's more hole than jacket"", which is almost as true too. I know it wasn't much in the way of warmth, but she seemed appreciative.  A little later that evening, we were talking in the hotel courtyard, and she kissed me on the cheek out of the blue. We kissed afterwards too, and this was a bit of a deal for me. It was one of the first times someone had really kissed me; I'd been in relationships before this, but all of them online, and ended before we met up offline. It wasn't the most elegant or romantic of places, but it was special nonetheless. We were kissing for a while, until it was time for her and her friend to head back to their hotel, which was down the road from mine. Me and two others walked with them, because we're gentlemen, even if we only had the one top hat between the three of us. And we were all homeward bound in the morning, so it was my last chance to see her for a while, although I did get contacts.  We spoke online and texted a bit after that, and eventually started going out, although, this ended after a few months because of distance issues. While I'm ok with distance, I know I can't expect others to be, and from East Anglia to the Scottish border is a bit much, especially with no reliable method of travel between the two places. (And by that, I mean affordable, and repeatable). It ended in a way where we didn't hate each other, and still got on. :)   Though, I never really did move on, even though both of us had seen others between then and now. Speaking of now, a bit of a time jump happens, to last weekend.  I was at a programming competition hosted by the same University she goes to. It's not far from where I go to University (she's in Lincoln, I'm in Hull. It's about 50 miles of distance between the two). We'd arranged to meet up for a drink after registration on the Friday, since it didn't start until Saturday, I had some free time. We'd spoken online and met up briefly at expos before this, so it wasn't the first time we'd seen each other since breaking up.  Anyways, we had a couple of drinks together, and decided to go to another pub, again, she had this odd ability to allow me to talk relatively freely compared to normal. En route, she kisses me. It wasn't something I was expecting, but after a brief moment of surprise, I return it; I still liked her, and neither of us were out of it. Several kisses and a drink later, we call it a date, and to be rather precise, it's our first one. Ever. I stayed at her's that night, and went to my competition in the morning. We parted with a kiss.  Time skip to the Sunday now, after the competition had ended (it was about 24/25 hours development time, plus judging, etc). And we meet up again to have a meal before I head back home; it was my treat, since I'd won a few quid at poker over the course of the competition. No drink this time though. But, even without it, she asked if she could call it our second date, (I'd asked about the first on Friday. Though, I wouldn't have done that if she hadn't kissed me.)  This all goes well. But my problem lies hereafter. Everything inside of me wants to give things another go. But I know a few things that might interfere with that. She's become scared of commitment, and I think that's because she blames herself for hurting people in the past. I don't know if the idea of this shorter distance will worry her or not. I think it's much more manageable, and if nothing else, I can cycle it in a few hours if need be. I also want to be able to ask without scaring her, or seeming too forward. I mean, we're good friends, and I think she'd understand if I asked, but I also know I can ask horribly badly and ruin that. Is it right to want to try again? Should I ask? I was thinking about asking after the coursework deadlines pass, is this a good thing to do?  Sorry, it's a really long post, but I figured if I wrote it all, it may help you understand my personal situation a bit better. And it lets me get it out of my system too. :) Thanks for reading this far alone, and thanks even more if you can offer some advice. :)",relationshipadvice

cfsr7j5,1zbo9d,Mr_Weebles,"&gt; So if that reasoning stands - can't down but can beat up - why would it fall under Lautenberg?  Because the specifics of his case aren't spelled out in his criminal record. It merely says he has been convicted of the crime of Aggravated Domestic Violence.   The key here is whether Michigan sent his conviction information to the NICS, which would stop him from buying a firearm from an FFL.

c2vce50,lswpy,extremethrowaway,"I know that conversation has its place in a relationship, but to be honest, I don't think this is the time. I really feel that it would be better to just take the actions that show how much you like her and want to be with her rather than talking it all through. (Again, I could be wrong, so be sure to filter what I'm saying.)  I think the key would be to actually ask her on a date in a confident, secure way. Make what you suggest you do for the date something that is obviously date-like (e.g., dinner and a movie) without being too casual (not out to coffee) or crazily romantic (not a picnic in the park with bouquets of flowers and all her favorite foods).  You could say, ""HERNAME, you are an amazing woman (or I love spending time with you or whatever is true) and I want to take you to dinner and then to see GREATFILM afterward. Unless it won't work for you, I'm going to pick you up this Saturday at 6:30. How's that sound?""  Then, on the date, ignore all the stuff that happened before and act like you would on any date with a woman you really like and hope will become your girlfriend.  If she says no to the date, offer the next day it will work. If she still says no, things may not be right for the two of you, and you certainly don't want to force yourself into a relationship with someone who isn't passionate right back about dating you.",relationshipadvice

6rhgs9,6rhgs9,CreepinBudda,My friend has rented out his basement apartment to a guy for the last 10 months. Over the winter he got behind on payments (two months behind) but promised to slowly pay it back as he was able to. He is a seasonal worker and so is my friend so he cut him some slack. The issue was he could never quite get ahead each month and now owes $3200. Finally he put his foot down and gave him until the end of July (full month notice). They then agreed that this weekend he would be out. Now the tenant is pushing it further into next week. He claims he will call the police if any of his stuff gets touched. They didn't sign a formal lease. He paid in cash for the other months. My friend has written agreements and documentation of all money owed including bank statements. What can be done here?

wmtv4,wmtv4,leqncy,"Ok. This dates way back as a kid.   In jr high. I met this girl. Let's just call her jennifer. We met at a punk show as a kid. Right there and then we knew we were best friends.   I then went on to try to date her ugly sister (didnt do a thing) just to be closer with her. (she knows that now).   So. Over the years we were close and sometimes flirted around. But we both had our paths and were kids.   Fast forward through her moving in with a LTR for 6 years.  She now has crossed paths with me. And within 5 minutes. If not seconds. We were already back to super awesomely close friends.   Now. That was about 6 months ago.  Her and her boyfriend broke up about 2 months ago.   We would see each other on weekends and go get some local sushi. As friends.   Now when her boyfriend left. I knew she needed help and I started seeing her more frequently.   Now I see her every day. And pretty much all of my free time those days.   I have always had strong attachment to this girl. She is kinda a big deal in my life.   With the hours we spend together.  We went from watching movies on opposite sides of the couch to her asking for hand massages to now foot leg and body massages and ""tickling""  I love this girl and I love the time spend with her. I don't even feel the need to have sex with her to complete me. (as I am a very sexual person usually).   I seriously feel she is the one. So. I tried bringing it up. In many forms. Funny. Serious. With friends around. While cuddling so on and so on. The response I always get is. ""I will never date you."". She finds me attractive. As she comments on so frequently. And she has been going on dates with people lately. But has always said no to me and it's making me really jelous.   So. We act like we are in a relationship. Cuddling around 24/7. We are inseparable. We pretty much are soul mates if I had to label it.   The reason I post after the whole long story. Is. I love this girl. And I want to bring her openly around family. I want to be able to give her a kiss.   I want to know what you guys think this all is.   I am happy where we stand. I just want that little more.   If its more advances I'm willing to try. She is very forgiving. And I have a feeling she suspects more. As I tweet about her every night and I tell her I'm lonely and want to cuddle.   Is there anything I can do that will make her suddenly realize how good we are and that we should be. Well us. But. More ""officially"".

c3btwor,nspk4,lawnessd,"26/m here.  I was in a three-year relationship that ended with a two-hour mutual discussion.  Afterward, we tried to get along, since we lived together, but this caused problems.  We had two bedrooms, and we didn't hook up or do anything once we had that discussion.  We tried to become friends, and it's what we both wanted.  Well, she wanted to tell me about every date she went on, and I didn't want to hear her cry about a guy who - - was-talking-to-her-at-the-same-time-he-was-talking-to-his-ex - - etc., etc.  I was nice about it, and we did try to get along, but for reasons such as these, being just friends and roommates wasn't going to work out.  To be fair and to qualify this, the relationship was wonderful.  And, despite that I didn't show any jealousy or frustration when she tried to talk about her personal life after we broke up, I certainly did feel it.  I just felt my role was neither to comfort her while she dated other guys within those first few months, or to be extremely mean and tell her to deal with her own shit; I just politely told her I did not wish to hear about every detail.  After 2 months of this, I tried a last-ditch effort to get her back, but right in the middle of planning it, she came home and saw me.  I tried to explain, tried to talk to her, and tried to put things in perspective -- that I knew I wanted to be with her, that she was my best friend, that she was everything to me -- but I could not.  I honestly could not believe that she had gotten over the three years in only a few weeks.  She moved out, on her own will because she could not handle the lease there by herself and she had another living opportunity available.  We didn't talk for almost a year after that, when she came back to get some more stuff she had left.  I've talked to her a couple times since then, only to settle certain things, like a bank account we had together (long, naive story there).  Anyway, there's my background, and here's my point.  I am so thankful that she cut off communication (and no, I didn't try to stalk her or blow up her phone -- I accepted it was over).  However, if she came back, called me up, wanted to hook up, or anything like that, it would have made the break up so much more difficult.  She was my first for a lot of things, such as love, sex, and blowjob.  And I was her first for many things (one sexual partner before me who was an abusive dick for whom sex consisted of an unemotional ""turn around"" into the spooning position, with clothes on).  I was the first person she made love to, first person she loved, lived with, cared about, was cared by, etc.  It was a special, wonderful relationship, and I wouldn't change that past for anything in the world.  I say all of this not to say I regret breaking up with her -- I don't.  I say this because within 5 months of us breaking up, she was pregnant.  A year after we broke up, I started dating again -- the summer right before I started law school.  Six months later, I met someone pretty wonderful, but it didn't work out.  Then, I met someone else pretty awesome, but she had an ex that she went back to.  A few months after that, I met a girl who was pretty great until she got the idea that all I wanted was sex (after a few great dates of not hinting anything of the sort).  After almost 2 years of being single, I realized what I logically and rationally knew all along -- that there are millions of women in the world.  We must dismiss the idea of a soulmate because it's probably in China, dead, or not born yet.  There billions a women -- millions within our age group, thousands that live near us, and hundreds we're compatible with and will interact with.  Many of them will provide a better relationship than the one that you just happened to make a connection with and fall in love with.  I have to go, so here's my last thought.  Update: I have been with a girl for 5 months now who is absolutely incredible.  We have an amazing connection, I see a future with us, we're on the same page as each other, and we have complete honest and open communication.  She makes me laugh, genuinely, hysterically -- which is a characteristic of no woman I've ever met, at least not to the extent that she does.  For instance, if I say something like, ""you're full of shit,"" she'll start laughing hysterically, unable to speak for several minutes.  Finally, after seeing a confused look on my face for several minutes, she'll say, ""I just pictured me being literally full of shit.""  Then we'll both start laughing hysterically.  It takes a while to get out of it, but you can't do it if there is that communication, sex, connection still open.  It's comfortable, but it's like a bandaid.  Rip it the fuck off, and don't reapply the same bandaid.",relationshipadvice

kq9wm,kq9wm,,"So, I went on an OkC date, which actually went really well. Except for the part where we were talking about dealbreakers and he mentioned being a virgin was an issue. We were also previously talking about cultural differences in attitudes towards sex and dating, and when he asked me directly about my first time, I probably should have said something - instead I ummed a little, he apologised saying if it was too personal a question, and I said yeah it kind of is and changed the subject.  Here's the thing. It's not because of religion. I just have really, really little experience dealing with dating, male attention, flirting or anything like that. I've gone on maybe 2 dates my whole life. I've been kissed once. (I was drunk). I'm not obese, I'm 175cm (5'9) and 63kg (140lbs). I've lost maybe 5kg over the past year, weight gained during college, and gone from a size 12/14 to a size 10/12. I've also been dealing with full body guttate psoriasis (~60% coverage) for the past 3 or so years. The 2 proper dates I've been on were before this started. Ironically I've become more confident about my body shape as I've developed a hideous skin disease. I guess if I wanted to there have been guys who have hit on me, or opportunities I could have pursued (mostly in the past year), but firstly, I don't really want to sleep with someone I'm not attracted to just for the sake of not being a virgin, and secondly, I'm really self conscious about the skin. I have scars (hyperpigmentation, actually) and red spots on my arms, legs, ass, back, shoulders, breasts. I'm not even sure I want anyone I'm attracted to to see it.   I don't know what I should do about this guy. I mean I'm kind of socially (dating-wise) stunted, and maybe I should have told him outright, but I didn't think it was first date conversation. Also it's all tied in with self esteem and other issues, and that's not a comfortable conversation at all. I like him, but I've barely ever dated.

4z7jdf,4z7jdf,DctrThrwy,"I had my pre-moveout inspection with my property manager yesterday.   Some background: the unit was newly-renovated when I moved in. The unit was supposed to be tiled, but we agreed to opt for carpet to avoid delays with the HOA that would push our move-in date back at the time. I've only lived there for a year.   Aside from the some typical wear that can easily be cleaned (e.g. dirty stove, dust, minor stains in kitchen and bathroom), the unit is in perfect working order and the property manager agreed. However, she brought up that deep cleaning would have to be done on the carpet and that I can hire someone myself, or they can have it done and deducted from my security deposit. During this conversation, there were a few things that kind of had me raising a brow:   - The fact that I had to deep-clean the carpet at all. It's not listed in lease agreement that it was required and from my previous rental experience, the tenant is responsible for cleaning the unit to extent of what it looked like when it was first moved into but landlord is usually responsible for any extra professional cleaning for the next tenants. - She said that since the unit was newly renovated, I had to return it to the same condition as when I moved it. She brought this up because she noticed some furniture indentations in the carpet and areas of heavy foot traffic where the carpet (barely) thinned. I'm familiar enough with California's Civil Codes to know that typical wear and tear is to be expected and not a responsibility of the tenant (CIV 1950.5.b.1). It’s as if she expects me to not have furniture or walk in my own home.  - In the case that I do hire someone myself, she mentioned doesn't guarantee that they won't re-do it to their standards—essentially my security deposit is still at risk. She state that her vendor would charge around $0.50/sqft so I’m looking at between $200-$350 for the shampoo and cleaning, which I definitely do not think I should have pay for.  I feel like I have the advantage here legally and I usually leave every place I rent **spotless** before I move out. I will be cleaning this unit as I usually do and will be taking pictures and video for the move-out inspection.   My question is: is there a specific civil code that explicitly defines “normal wear and tear”? How do I make it clear to her that she can’t charge me for the deep-cleaning? In what ways would she be justified in deducting from my security deposit? And if she does end up deducting from my security deposit, in which county should I file a small claims (currently in SoCal, but moving to NorCal)?   **TL;DR**: Property manager is trying to get me to pay for deep-cleaning or she’ll likely take it out of my security deposit. I don't think I should be responsible for this beyond leaving the unit clean. What are my options before taking any legal action? What should I do if I do have to take legal action?",legaladvice

30e3m2,30e3m2,DidIGetFleeced,"A couple of weeks ago, I entered into a financing agreement for a vehicle from a small used car dealership. The financing price of the vehicle was $4300. I gave the car a test drive and all-around visual inspection, aside from actually going underneath the motor. The top looked clean and in good condition, and aside from a mild knocking sound, there seemed to be no issues with the vehicle. I was specifically told that a $90 knock sensor was the only thing the car needed to be fully mechanically sound, so I took their word for it and signed the paperwork. I made the mistake of taking it to a service shop *after* signing the paperwork, and found out it will need typical maintenance expected of a vehicle of that age. Head gaskets, timing belt, water pump, etc. The CV joints and R&amp;P assembly also need maintenance. All in all, the repairs will cost me a little under $4000. With the car up on the lift, I looked underneath with the mechanic and was floored at how this car could even be sold as-is. I was told the vehicle received a full inspection and emissions testing. A code reader plugged into the car also showed codes relating to the catalytic converter having issues. The dealership and financing company have both denied to work with me in any way on paying for the repairs, lowering the price of the vehicle, etc. I have yet to finalize the sale by signing the title, and haven't made my first payment (other than the $1500 down.) I've done some googling around for similar cases, and from what I can tell, if I was specifically misrepresented on the condition of the car by the dealer, I may have some chance of recourse. The car was sold as-is, no warranty, however. If this is just a case of youthful naivety that I have no way out of, so be it. I feel as though the wool was pulled over my eyes, and at the very least this is bad business ethics from this dealership.

At the time I had primary and secondary insurance, the primary being Kaiser and the secondary being Medi-Cal. The hospital I went to wasn’t Kaiser affiliated. I gave the hospital both my primary and secondary insurance during the time of the visit. Due to not receiving a bill until March 2017 it led me to believe my insurance paid the bill. Well after receiving the bill and being unable to pay it I just let it sit. Four months later in July I received a collections notice for the medical bill. During those four months from April till July I never received any other bill notices or reminders from the hospital so I started to believe my secondary insurance finally picked up on the payment that was until I received the collections notice. Ever since I received the collections notice I’ve been going back and forth with my secondary insurance for them to pay the bill which they said they will pay in full since they cover emergency room visits they just needed to confirm I had their coverage during the time of the visit. After they confirmed I had coverage they had me fax them the bill, after doing so I was never contacted back so I called them again after 3.5 months of waiting, re-explained my situation to a different representative and was told I needed to do something entirely different after proceeding to do what the representative claimed I needed to do with her on the line she told me to wait for either the company she just had me contact to contact me back or for the Medi-Cal offices to contact me back. Well here it is about 5 or 6 months later and I still haven’t been contacted. Honestly I haven’t even tried re-contacting them because at this point I’m tired of the back and forth game they play especially since it’s gotten me nowhere. To this day I’m still being billed for the hospital visit but with interest now from the collections company. The bill goes up $13-$17 every month, yet I don’t receive a physical bill in the mail. The only way I know of this increase every month is from looking at the collection balance of that account through my credit score account. So my question is how can I get this handled without having to pay the collection company and without having to deal with the back and forth game my secondary insurance keeps playing?  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; TLDR: Received a collections notice for a hospital visit I had insurance coverage for. Trying to get it fixed but my insurance is giving me the runaround.     --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice

yxep3,yxep3,,"EDIT: I'm not actually sure if we're bf/gf yet (didn't word the title well, sorry), but you'll read about that lower in the thread, lol.   Long story short, I took this girl on a date last night -- dinner and a movie (I put my arm around her and everything -- it was really nice). I was a bit wary at first because we're two completely different people, but everything went exceptionally well, and she even admitted that she would've kissed me if I'd made a move, but I can't take a hint and idk how to kiss anyway -- never got that far with the ex.   So, my ex broke up with me because I was too clingy. There's a *lot* more backstory (she had issues and I was green behind the ears), but I do take responsibility for part of the breakup. One of the things that I'm afraid I'll mess up on is how often am I allowed to contact this girl? So far, we've talked for the last four nights straight -- she initiated each of the conversations -- but the same thing happened with my ex, and I took that as a sign that it was okay to text her every day, but it clearly it wasn't. So, to reiterate, how often should I text her?   We're going on a second date (not everything's set in stone because we're both busy with work and need to figure out our schedules) -- which bring me to my second question: When are we ""official""? My last relationship (not the best reference point, but it's the only one I've got) became ""official"" after one date -- approximately three or four days after, but it might've been different because my ex and I had mutual friends we hung out with after the first date, and that's not the case with the girl I'm...dating (if that's the word for it at this point). I asked her after our date, and she (inadvertently) stated that she wasn't ready for that yet. The real question is: When is it appropriate for me to ask again without being a pest or...clingy?  Thanks for any assistance, everybody! I really like this girl, and I want this relationship to outlast my weeklong previous one.",relationshipadvice

1spx7k,1spx7k,,"My SO is excellent at keeping a cool appearance and acting like things are fine, when really everything is not fine. I'm not speaking about he and I, we're good and there's no problem between us, but, he doesn't talk to me about what's going on in his mind. I keep telling him that I want him to talk to me and I'm here for him when he needs to. I've told him he doesn't have to talk to me, but I'd like for him to tell me what's going on in his life, what's bothering him, etc. Recently, we've both been busy with finals and whatnot so we've not been able to see one another very much over the past few weeks. I was texting with him and felt the need to tell him that I want him to talk to me about what's going on in his life, not just about what has gone on in his day, what he saw on reddit (yes, he's a fellow redditor), etc. Yes I do care about those things and I want to know about them, but if something is bothering him to the point he can't sleep or can't eat or think I'd really love for him to tell me. Turns out he's had some really crazy stuff going on and spent a few days debating if he should talk to me about it or not. He ended up talking to me, but after a little while he changed he asked to change the subject...understandably so, it involves his ex contacting him about personal matters that regard our relationship...it was weird, but that's another story for another post.   From what I've noticed about him, he's a super private person, and keeps most things to himself. So the fact that he's come to me before telling me some things is an honour and I cherish that wholeheartedly, but, it's not a constant trust and it's difficult for me to get things out of him. His best friend who he's known his entire life was talking with me about this thing with his ex contacting him about us and that it's been bothering him to the point where he can't sleep, I talked to him as much as I could about it without making it awkwarder and I wasn't gonna push him to talk about it unless he wanted to because it's a touchy subject, obviously. His friend mentioned to me that he rarely talks about his problems to anyone not even him, nor his family. There are things that have bothered him that his family didn't even know.   I don't know how to help him trust me and I know he does, but it shouldn't be like pulling teeth to find out what is bothering him. Also, I tell him everything, there's little he doesn't know, and he's told me he likes knowing what's bothering me or what's on my mind. But, if I'm telling him all of my issues, even just to vent and confide in someone and he's giving me nothing I feel guilty...especially if he has problems to the point where he's not able to properly function. I feel guilty I'm dumping my issues on him when he has a mountain of issues I didn't even know about till after the fact. This whole thing makes me incredibly burdened for him and I want to help him in any way I can.   **TL;DR -** basically, I want to help my SO feel comfortable enough to trust me and like he's safe with me. I'm just not sure how to get into his mind and understand what he's going through...especially if he's not telling me and appears like everything is peachy keen on the outside.",relationshipadvice

9ouvgj,9ouvgj,nncats,"Hello - posting on mobile apologies for formatting. I will do my best to explain this as clearly as possible, posting on behalf of my boyfriend (I have been around since the beginning of the business).   My bf started a business about 1.5 years ago, and had a small investor. The investor gave him a 9K check with “loan” in the memo, and bought a vehicle in [investor’s] name for bf to drive and operate the business out of. Business can’t be done effectively without this vehicle. When they started this, they made a verbal agreement that [investor] would be a part of the business, helping keep things running / be fairly present &amp; accessible / make further financial investments. He also strong armed out another potential partner that would have done a lot of background work. There was never any paper contract or discussion of repayment for the vehicle nor the 9K.  As the business went on [investor] became less &amp; less involved, rarely calling, never checking in, not accessible. This wasn’t a problem as bf was staying busy, making money, and things were moving along, but as time went on, bf started to feel like things weren’t moving in the direction he had originally wanted, and he was doing too much labor, and not receiving the necessary behind the scenes support to grow the way he had originally planned.   Investor &amp; bf met and investor said that he would be more available in the future but that he was having some legal trouble, however, he would not ask for any money without contributing to the business. Ok, fine, no problem. We also find out that investor has lost all his money to lawyers and issues because of his legal issues, and he may be going to prison. Investor is contacting every few months basically promising to do more for the business in the future, mentioning large scale jobs / financial benefits for the business.   So on one random contact investor asks to meet up with bf and they do. At the meeting Investor asks my bf to commit a huge financial crime offering him the van in exchange. Bf immediately turns him down. Investor essentially says that without doing this, he may go bankrupt and have to take the van soon. Bf says that’s fine (at this point he’s ready to move on to other opportunities in his life anyways), just please give him 30 days notice so he can wrap up his jobs and have some time to transition.   Then a few weeks later, investor asks my bf to provide work to his son, a person we know to  have drug problems &amp; who has literally no experience in the field, and as my bf if preparing to transition away from the business he didn’t have much work anyways, so he politely said that he couldn’t provide work for the son.  Investor then essentially blows up and says that he’s “spent all this money on [bf]” and that he will be needing the van back soon. Bf says sure, he doesn’t want the van to be held over his head anyways. No response for investor.   Today, a week later from the son conversation, by receives a text saying he needs the vehicle back ASAP.  At this point, we were advised by a friend that he is breaching a verbal contract by taking the van and that my bf shouldn’t need to worry about the 9K. I am curious what everyone here thinks of this and any advice for next steps. Thanks for reading &amp; advising.",legaladvice

19grv7,19grv7,Toasted_Turtle,"Lately my girlfriend has been less emotional around me, apathetic even. Her texts to me are becoming dull and infrequent when we used to text all of the time. But when we hang out together alone she's a totally differ dr person, smiling, laughing and being a friend as well as girlfriend.  Then in school she goes back to being uninterested in me and distant. It's gotten worse lately and I don't know if I did something wrong or if it's her. Could she be seeing someone else? I thought she loved me. The anxiety is killing me. And she's going to another college visit this week a few states away. She went to a party at the last one and ended up being cranky and hungover all day.  I'm so worried that she cheated on me that it hurts. Should I ask her if something's bothering her again (last time she said no)? Some background info- this is the first serious relationship that either of us have been in and we lost our virginity together. She says she loves me but I don't know if she is just saying that now.

c14ysub,e0h2a,k1dsmoke,"Do you live near a major city?  Personally I used r/stlouis to help plan my first couple of dates with the girl I've been seeing the past couple of months.  Try checking whatever major city you live near and find something interesting to do; especially festivals, and interesting places to eat.  (not chain restaurants)  Also, don't worry about trying to sell yourself to her.  Bullshitting only works if you are a bullshitter.  Bank on your genuineness.  If you are a good listener a talkative girl will enjoy that.  Try banking on planning a fun EVENT rather than being entertaining yourself.  If you go somewhere even slightly interesting it will give you neutral things to talk about, i/e what events are going on at the moment, joke about etc.  Find out some more of what her interests are, and try to plan a date around that.  Don't go overboard and do a dozen things in one day.  Just choose one interesting thing to do, maybe one interesting place to eat, and if you still have time left over then go back watch a movie, or go have a drink at a quiet bar, go for a walk, whatever.  If you are a good listener, and have spent much of your life as a listener I am going to go ahead and assume you are an observant person, and that maybe you have gleaned a thing or two about this girl.    An example, the girl I am seeing is really in to art, and we both love old architecture.  While out on a date at a festival she noticed a building she had never took note of before.  It had a mosaic on it's ceiling that we both really enjoyed.  For years I've been wanting to take a date to the St Louis Basilica.  She has various styles and artists that I've learned that she likes, but I know she appreciates art in general.  I love architecture and old buildings, and I was banking that the art of the mosaics would be interesting to her.  I also planned a late lunch/early dinner at mom n pop restaurant I found in the area.  She loved it.   I didn't need to worry about thinking of something funny or entertaining to say, because what we were doing was entertaining enough, and provided conversation for later that day.  All I can say is to be honest, and do your best.  After my second date, I confessed that I hadn't dated in four years (had a bad break up the last time, and spent four years not interested in relationships).  I asked her if it was okay if we took it slow, and she told me that 'slow was good'.  Again, be yourself, and be honest.  If she doesn't accept you for who you are then you have nothing to feel bad about, because you didn't do anything wrong.  You just weren't right for each other, and there is no shame in that.

Which is complete horse shit because I would come smooch her and maybe give her the ""i want to do you look"" but wouldn't do anything just to see if she would start it..nothing.  So I told her how I felt about it and that I wish she would initiate it.  Her excuse was that I always seem busy or I'm on the computer. Guys of reddit, tell me if I'm wrong here but I seriously doubt any dude would say no to sex because of youtube videos.  So after all this she ends up coming back from a trip to miami, I'm in bed (this literally just happened) waiting for her to get home.

Last year, a guy, who I connect with very well, and my group of friends(including my boyfriend) began hanging out and spending a lot of time together. We all have great chemistry and have tons of fun. However, a close friend of mine [20F] brought up how the guy mentioned above is constantly flirting with me. He goes out of his way to talk with me, help me out, grab my attention, etc. I denied her claim, but i soon came to realize that her observations were accurate.    After she pointed this out to me, I have become aware of the flirtatious actions more and more.  I then confronted several of my other friends about who the guy was interested in(for a relationship) and they all had the same reaction: they all got really quiet and mumbled that he is in love with me. I proceeded to ask my boyfriend and he said that he noticed it as well and that's why he pulls me closer when the three of us are together. My boyfriend also mentioned that he has no trust issues however because he knows I mean the world to him too, and that he is fine with the guy and I being friends because the guy and I have a different sort of chemistry that I don't necessarily have with my bf(bf said this).    I truly love my bf and don't want my relationship to end anytime soon, but I am concerned about  this other guy. I don't necessarily feel averse to being attracted to the guy because we do get along VERY well and he seems to care about me too. Before any accusations start coming, I am not flirtatious with the guy at all. As soon as we met I informed him that my boyfriend and I were extremely happy. The guy knows I love my bf and the feeling is reciprocated because my bf always is holding my hand, hugging me, kissing me, etc. I hope the guy to be holding out for me...    I just want to be happy with my current loving bf because you know the saying  ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". But I fear that this guy may begin stressing my bf out with his advances towards me and the guys constant attention (on me) may be influencing my emotions.

She wants to go out and party to meet guys that aren't you. This sucks and I'm sorry to have to say it. I know it hurts, but the more you try to stop her, the more she is going to resent you for it. You have to let her get it out of her system and get tired of going to parties and meeting jerks.

I'm active duty military stationed overseas, and we will be returning back to the states in January.  Our marriage has had a LOT of ups and downs. She has cheated on me on 6 different locations, and after each of them, either because I had rose colored glasses on, was stupid, or there was a child involved who I thought it was best that ""I try to make it work"".

So far we have been extremely civil with each other, trying to make things as easy as possible for us, and the kids. I slept in the guest bedroom last night, and my 4 year old was quick to point it out and ask why. The wife has suggested that until we move, and she finds a place, we carry on as normal.

Do I continue for the next five months as normal, being as close with my soon to be ex wife as we were before the decision, or do I make next five months harder for me, her, and the kids, by separating while we're in the house?

9ai0sf,9ai0sf,the_hammock_hut,"Over the past year, I hired a contractor to build a house. My neighbor next to me has also been building his house, and was about 4 months behind me in the building process. When approaching the end of the construction of my house back in April, my builder and I decided that he would install an underground French drain along the side of my driveway and between my house and my neighbor's house in order to catch water that would flow from his land. My lot is slightly downhill from his, and I was concerned about water and mud from his land washing onto my driveway and yard.  When it was time for installation, my builder had his usual landscaping company come out and do the work. At first it worked great, but over time less and less water would come of out the exit drain at the back of my property, even during heavy rainfalls. Meanwhile water and mud was staring to pool over where the drain was buried. This told me that the drain was clogged or there was some other issue with it that needed addressing.  After talking with my builder about it, he talked to the landscaper and discovered that the landscaper installed the French drain on the neighbors lot, which meant I couldn't dig it up or redo it. My neighbor had recently finished his house and doesn't want to tear up his new landscaping, which is understandable.  At first we assumed it was a mistake and the landscaper wasn't aware of exactly where the property line was. Then he told us that he did know about the property line but installed it on my neighbors property anyway. He claims my neighbor's builder and him got together and decided the best place for it was not next to my driveway, but a few feet over the line and not on my lot. Why they decided this, I don't know. It's been four months and my builder and I are just finding out. The landscaper didn't let anyone else know about it until now.  My perspective is this: I want a refund for the cost of the French drain (over $1000) since it's no longer working and now belongs to my neighbor since it's on his property. And now I'm in the position of having paid for something but having no control of fixing and maintaining it, causing the whole thing to be pointless. The refund would be coming from my builder since I ultimately paid him and he then paid the subcontracting landscaper separately.  The builder and landscaper are resistant though and are pushing back, saying that despite where it's located, it's still possible that the drain will do what it's supposed to do. In the end, if they won't give me my money back, what recourse do I have?  Location: North Carolina  *TL:DR: Guy building my house hired a landscaper to install a French drain, and the landscaper intentionally put it on my neighbor's property. Now the French drain isn't working properly and my neighbor doesn't want me tearing up his landscaping to fix it. So I'm stuck with paying for a drain that doesn't work and is not even on my property and I want a refund.*  *Link to crude illustration.

d99dgo5,59bx2v,taterbizkit,"I meant ""criminal trespass"" in that he's charged with a trespassing-related crime.  The other kind is ""civil trespass"", which the owner can sue you for if you cause damage to their property.  If you're out in the woods where there are no property markers, and you cross into someone's property without knowing you've done so, that's still trespassing -- you're in another's property without permission.  Your knowledge isn't required.  But that's a civil matter.  If you *know* you're on the property of another without permission, that's a criminal trespass.  The intent element is supplied by being there with knowledge that you shouldn't be.  The statute you cited talks about a notice requirement -- fences and signage.  Those rules establish ""constructive knowledge"" -- so even if you didn't *actually* know, you should have known, so we're going to prosecute you anyway.  However, in many jurisdictions, even though the statute may describe notice requirements, if it can be proven that you did *actually* know you were trespassing, then criminal trespass can be charged.  Even if there are no signs, no fences.  In most residential areas, you don't need a sign to tell you that you've entered the property of another.  Even in areas where there are no fences between houses (like where my brother lives in WI), at some point you know you're trespassing.  Notice is *moot* at that point.  Now it's probably true that this guy is being a petty asshole and using his authority to harass your friend.  That sucks ass, but it doesn't automatically invalidate the charge.  I don't mean to be a jerk by this, but ""citing officer must not be acting in a petty or childish manner"" is not an element of the statute you cited.  That it took a week to get written won't invalidate a charge that probably has a six-month statute of limitation (or thereabouts).  That it was another officer who wrote the ticket doesn't matter either.  And unless a charge is dismissed ""with prejudice"", they can always fix their errors and start over.    I get that this all feels like it adds up to something a court should not take seriously, but your friend has to treat it as though it does.  If he satisfied the elements of the crime (knowingly remain on the property of another without permission), he can be convicted of it.",legaladvice

m9r20,m9r20,,"I thought I had thought this through but now I find myself feeling like a huge jerk.  So I started dating a woman (let's call her Sue) about a month ago. We've had 6 dates in that period of time. Things were good but they weren't perfect. This feeling became much more noticeable when I met the most amazing woman ever 2 weeks ago (let's call her Laura). I didn't get Laura's phone number at first because I had already gone on a couple dates with Sue. Less than a week goes by and Sue and I plan on going to a play (for her birthday) a week later and we buy some tickets.   Not 2 days later I hear from a friend that Laura was asking about me and seeing if I was available. So being completely enamoured by her, I contact her through Facebook and setup a date.  At this point I should have broken it off with Sue but I figured, why end a relationship without knowing if the new relationship is going to go anywhere? Sounds like a good plan? Nope.  I end up going on 2 dates with Laura that week and by the end of the 2nd date we're making out on the couch (nothing more).  That was yesterday. Tonight Sue and I went to the play. I should have ended it but it was her birthday. The worst part is that I've been sleeping with her since our third date and I had sex with her tonight. Knowing full well that I was going to break up with her. Fuck I'm an asshole.  So now I still need to break it off with Sue but I feel this overwhelming urge to come clean with Laura. I really feel like I have a future with Laura and that's why I feel I need to be honest with her. Especially this early in the relationship. What do I say to her?  Note: I never agreed to be exclusive with either of them, but I didn't tell either of them that I wasn't.",relationshipadvice

Look at it this way:   Scenario 1: I catch him in a lie. Of course then he tells me he is trying to change the lying habit. How else would he get me to stay?  Scenario 2: He fesses up to lying before I even realize, and tells me he's trying to change because he wants to be a better person for me.

pg0l7,pg0l7,,"My girlfriend (Bisexual) and I have been together a little over 2 years, and have had these issues since the beginning of the relationship. At the start of the relationship, I was a little jealous of things, but not super overbearing, and she wasn't too jealous until a few months in either.   This is in the first year of the relationship, I'm not going to go into too much detail about everything, but just important details.  We both had issues about lieing, or not telling the other about something. One night she got drunk and made out with one of her friends (a girl) and didn't tell me until a few months later, and I forgave her, but didn't really trust her around girls very much at all. And I lied about not having sex with a girl that I had before (way before the relationship started), and she found out from that girl later on, after we went on a break, because I thought I had lost feelings for her.   Fast forward to after we get back together (after about a 2 or 3 month break, with still hanging out a bit, just not boyfriend/girlfriend), she's less jealous, and so am I. We have a few hitches in the relationship that I won't go into, but she starts getting jealousy issues again, if I even look at a girl, or really talk to friends that are girls. (Note: I've never cheated on her in this whole relationship) This would have its ups and downs, of sometimes where she wouldn't be jealous, and sometimes where she would, all the while, I was eventually able to get rid of my jealousy completely for the most part in the 2nd year of our relationship, until recently.   Recently she's been getting more jealous, she's told me it's because she's jealous/envious of girls she wants to look like, even though I don't like those types of girls that she wants to look like, which makes 0 sense to me. Her jealousy in the last 2 months recently brought back my jealousy for some reason, and it happens with both guys and girls. I don't want to leave her, as I love her, but this is tearing me apart and has been for a while.  Whenever I try to talk to her about it, she gets mad, and pretty much will never talk about it, and just ignore our problems, even though she and I both have said communication is key.  Don't take this in a way where one or the other is at fault, as we both have our problems, I just would like to know if there is some kind of solution that would help this (other than counseling, as it's too expensive) and other than breaking up, as I do love her very much still.

At the end of this last school year she all of the sudden started to show interest in me and asked me to go the movies, since then, we have been on about 4 dates, one of which was a movie at her house.   Two weeks ago he asked me to a super formal girl-ask-guy dance thats not until October, I said yea because... I don't know... I was kindve on the spot. She texts me alot and wants to hang out more. Her friends have told me that she really likes me an she wants me to ask her out.   How can I tell her in the nicest way possible that I would prefer to stay friends. I've pretty much come to grips with that I can't have a girlfriend until after the dance, but that's not a problem, I've gone 17 years without a girlfriend, I can wait 3 more months.   Although it does anger me because I was just finally building up the confidence to ask out a girl I have had a crush on for quite a while when this girl started to show interest in me and put a stop to my plans. I would like to start to build a relationship with the other girl between now and October if I can figure how to friendzone girl 1. Of course, if that happens, I'll come back here for more advice on how to do that.   Edit: more details.

n46o9,n46o9,thowowowoway,"Okay, here goes, a long one.  Friends with her for 10 years, always been chemistry between us. We'd, even when we had partners, go on late night drives after I'd finished work and get dessert together, without telling respective partners. Never any moves made, but we would open up to each other about problems we had in our relationships and general life stuff.  Fast forward a few years and we begin seeing each other after I finally made the move and kissed her after we'd been out for dinner. At first it was a sexual thing, but generally moved across to a dating scenario. We didn't tell any mutual friends for a long time in fear of losing them should something happen between us. They eventually clued on and everyone seems to know now.   That's the basic background, now the issues. We've been together for a while now (3/4 of a year), but she refuses to call me a boyfriend and gets shitty if I call her my girlfriend. In social situations she acts like a stranger, despite people knowing. My friends want me to leave her as they claim it's too weird. On the flipside, there's a whole lot of self esteem issues and I suspect a strange jealousy thing going whenever I'm with other girls. She claims I'm the best thing for her, sweet and loving and all the rest, yet I feel she keeps me at arms length.   She'll chat on facebook to different guys for hours, claiming they're just friends. I've read a couple of the conversations and they're innocent for the most part, though perhaps with a touch of flirting that she's known for - that kind of flirting that makes you wonder if she's keen or just nice.  I've told her it's like dating two separate people. One side is the one when we're alone, she's great - sweet, intelligent, interesting, gets along with my family and I get along well with hers. Then there's the other side, one that I feel ignores me, refuses to be associated with me and, possibly, entertains herself with chatting to other possibilities.   Now here's the kicker - Five years ago she was raped, twice. I sat down and spoke to her a while back thinking I was going to end it as we'd been shitty at eachother over something or other for a few days. From memory I think it was about her being distant on a recent camping trip, where she refused to say she was with me when asked. I asked, ""Do you want me?"" to which she replied ""Yes and no.""   ""Yes because you're too good for me, the perfect boyfriend. You're sweet, caring and you get along with everyone. No because I know I hurt you by being disinterested. It's what I became after it happened. I have trouble keeping my life together. I feel if we're out and you hold my hand everyone will judge me.""  I told her I'm not going to leave her if that's the reason why she's acting so strange. I'm not a monster, and I knew there'd be issues going in to the relationship.   But I've told her now that she should try to make positive moves in her life. I told her I want to help - it's what I'm here for - and gave her suggestions on what to do to make things easier on herself. I've asked her to try and get more sleep as I know she doesn't get enough - but I still see her on facebook, probably chatting to some other guy, until 1am when she has work at 6am. I've suggested she should look into a new job where she has passion, and even did a little groundwork in inquiring about some jobs she's described as her dream job, but never got a thankyou or anything. I tried to get her more involved with our friends who she felt she was losing touch with by organising a surprise birthday party to show they cared - nothing. I want her over at my place more because I know she's relaxed here, but I constantly get excuses.  I don't know. I just don't. How much effort am I going to need to put in to make this work? Or am I trying too hard and smothering a girl that can't handle that? She still doesn't see me as a boyfriend despite the fact I've told her I love her and want to see her happy. I bend over backwards for her, yet I'm the one who has to talk her into spending time with me.

1ngjx1,1ngjx1,,"About 8 months ago, I had a really bad breakup with my ex, we can call her Leah. Leah was a really nice girl, just immature. Around Christmas time we started fighting a lot about her smoking pot and my strong feelings against smoking it. It would escalate from the main issue to the two of us just trying to hurt each other emotionally. Long story short, it drove a wedge between us and she cheated on me on Christmas day with her neighbor. We broke up and didn't talk again for many months. My relationship after her fell apart due to me being sexually abused. A month or two went by and then I got a new girlfriend and we broke up last week for reasons I can't put on here, and me and Leah started talking again. I don't know if I should get back with her after all the abuse we threw at each other for the weeks leading up to and after we broke up.  Can you guys help me out with deciding whether I should give it another shot?",relationshipadvice

lczdi,lczdi,,"So here's the details. I've been dating this girl for about two months now and she became very attached. Clinginess isn't the issue here it's the fact that we aren't compatible at all. I'm an athiest and she is a devout Christian who tries to get me to come to church with her. I don't believe that a relationship has to be ALL physical but it is a good thing, she believes that the physical aspect takes the romance out of a relationship. Don't like the same music, most of her friends hate me, whenever I'm with her her family refuses to leave us alone so I feel like I'm being babysat not like I'm in a relationship. She isn't allowed to ride with me or any of my friends because her mom thinks we're going to wreck and die and she isn't allowed to come over to my house because me and her were kissing on her couch and her mom saw and assumed that's all we do at my house. So I've mainly lost interest. Also there is another girl. She is awesome, we have similar taste in music, food, art, movies. Her parents allow her dating freedom. She drives and has her own car. We've watched scary movies together and she's curled up next to me and ""hid"" in my shoulder. She's cute and is friends with my friends so that's not a problem either. I'm 17 but I'm not a sissy with women so I admitted to her that I like her and she said that she's had a crush on me since the night my friend introduced us. I'm a teenage guy but I have respect so i haven't kissed her because I'm not going to cheat no matter what. But I am going to leave my current girlfriend for her but I need to figure out how to do it softly. Please help me out.",relationshipadvice

After he got issued the ticket and drove away, my buddy noticed that the cop wrote his mothers name on the ticket and her date of birth. The only correct peice of information was the gender. Couple days later the cop gets in touch with my friend and requested he meet with him. My friend had work and could not. The following day the cop showed up at 8AM at his front door knocking and ringing the doorbell. He opens the door and the cop handed him a new ticket. My friend replied that he already wrote him the other ticket and he sent it in ""Not Guilty."" Cop responded saying that ticket is being dismissed.

krnti,krnti,dunnowhattothink,"I'm lost! This won't be easy to explain but I desperately need advice!  So I am in this town on business. Instead of going to a hotel for two nights, I rang up a good friend who lives here to see if I could crash at his place. Being very kind, he agreed of course. So I arrive in the evening and offer to go out to a bar, drinks on me. Cool.  We sit down have a couple of beers, when he asks me if a girl friend of his may join us. He explains that they've known each other for 3 months, working at the same company in the same department (it's his last week on the job though). I said sure, bring it on. 20 minutes and another beer later, said lady arrives, we greet and: insta-spark, ""very nice to meet you too, fair lady"".  At that point, I have no deeper knowledge of their level of ""intimacy"". To me, it was like he said. They met on the job, had a few nights out together as friends. Nothing ever happened between them and nothing in progress.  We have another round of beers together, it's getting late, the lady decides to head home, everybody agrees, everybody needds to get up early the next day.  Being the gentlemens we are, we escort her back to her place, which is a major detour for us. Half way somewhere between the bar, her place and his place, he suggests we all sleep at his place. She agrees instantly, ensues intense eye contact with me. So we reroute to his place.  I open a bottle of wine I brought as a gift while they both set up the mattress in his room next to his bed. Okay. We have a few more sips and laughs. By now, we're all pretty wasted, we get ready for bed and head to his room where we all jump onto his bed. Okay too. Sexual energy is in the air.  Never had a threesome, but why not... Things start heating up, but she keeps rejecting his advances. First in a laughing way, but as he keeps insisting on ""joining in"", she suggests her and I move to the living room. Said, done. We move. We have sex. Sex produces noise. We close the door between his room and the living room.  After our business, we go for a smoke at the kitchen window. He enters the kitchen and asks if we have 10 minutes. Doesn't take a genius to figer out he is super pissed.  So we say: ""yeah, sure! what's going on?"" He says: ""Great. Then you have ten minutes, starting now. Everything that does not belong to me in this appartment will be flying out the window after that.""  Ouch.  We don't say a word, pack our things and leave. We go to her place and finish the night there. I remember I have left my external hard drive at his place for him to grab some movies. It also contains precious personal stuff and, what's more important, work stuff and confidential documents. I am an idiot.  I text him that i was sorry, that i stepped over the line big time, abused of his generosity and friendship and that I wanted to apologize in person if he agrees to speak with me.  No answer.  I try calling him the next day. He wouldn't pick up.  I have just destroyed a perfectly good friendship for nothing... And now I need some outside thoughts on that gigantic mess i just created.  Insert details:  - My buddy and I have met two years ago. Time spent ""together"" is about 5 months.  - I have a girlfriend.    UPDATE:  He finally answered my last text after I made it clear to him that it is cruicial for me to get my hard drive back. I even suggested we make a blind trade if he does not want to see me (eg. he leaves it in the hallway and lets me come pick it up). He agreed. I arrive at his appartment, he opens the door.  I was surprised he would see me. I ask him if he really doesn't want to talk yet. He sais: ""not really"". I said that it's OK and that I hope we would talk over this whenever he feels the time is right. He nods. I apologize face to face (felt so much better then via text!) and tell him again how sorry I was for ruining the night and maybe our friendship.  He didn't look quite as pissed as the night before, though. He tells me that he bears a grudge. I tell him I understand and that I will wait for him to feel comfortable talking to me.  I leave.",relationshipadvice

She took that as a cue to punch multiple gaping holes in the wooden wall of our upstairs hallway using a piece of wood. Lines have split in the paint where you can see the individual sections of wooden planks coming apart. There are 12 holes in all, 5 large and gaping. It will cost upwards of $1000 to repair.

cfug4me,1zk6lm,titoblanco,"&gt; Everything damaged or disgusting about the house was well-documented in the initial walkthrough with pictures and checklists filled out.  Then why did you sign the lease if the unit was not in an acceptable condition  &gt; -Many things that were put in writing to be fixed by a certain date were ignored completely or took far past the agree-upon date to be addressed, including a couple things that may be genuine safety concerns.  If you have a contract that requires them to fix those items you can go to court and enforce the contract. If it is a safety violation that constitutes a breach of the warranty of habitability you can give him notice and he will either cure it or he won't, in which case you can terminate the lease and move out.  &gt; I pay my rent in a very under the table way which my landlord insisted upon. It involves depositing any combination of cash and checks into his bank account which is at a bank located up the street from me. I have records of all of these deposits.  There is nothing under the table about that. That is a very common means for private landlords to collect rent. I have both paid and collected rent by that means myself.   &gt; The door to my room is off its hinges with a splintered frame. My landlord said we would have to discuss the ""cost"" of fixing it, implying that I would have to pay for it.  He probably suspects that it was damaged during the tenancy, a kicked in door is not typical wear and tear. If it was not already damaged you may be liable for that damage either now or at the end of your tenancy  &gt; I guess my question is, what are my rights as a tenant? What can I demand that he fixes? I have been complacent about a lot of things which may nullify any upper hand I would have.

I mean, this is a guy she cheated on you with. It's okay to say, ""this continued communication makes me uncomfortable"" --regardless if he is a rapist or not.  Basically, I think what you want is for someone to say ""it's not okay for her to be talking to that other guy"" (which is why you included the ""serial womanizer"" bit...to make yourself look like a better logical choice by comparison).

I usually date people about 10 years older.   The date went really well. Although we were both obviously nervous. But conversation never stopped and we talked about things I know for sure people cannot usually talk about on a first date. Spiritual stuff. We were on the same wavelength and knew things that most people don't talk about. So just finding someone like that is rare.   He asked me out. He set up the date. I told him when I was available and he choose the first day possible. He was on time. Etc etc  I decided the day after the date I would be bold and text him that I had fun and wanted to see him again. I did that mainly because my age is probably intimidating so I wanted to reassure him that I thoroughly enjoyed his company.   He responded saying he had fun too and would like to take me out again.   Four days go by and nothing so I decide to text and ask how his weekend went. We chatted for a while. That was a week and a half ago and we haven't spoke.   So my questions are: Should I text him again?  If so what should I say?  If he hasn't reached out does that mean he probably isn't interested?

And you know what the best part of it is? You're not going to do that because you need to puff yourself up for her to like you. You're going to do it simply and solely because it makes her happy, and her happiness is what you care about.   This means you don't hold back on compliments, ever. Death is winning, Blinky, and life is short. If you pass up this chance to make her day better, *you will never get it back.* You may get another one like it, but this one is gone. If you have a chance to make someone's day better, even if it's 11:24 at night and you think this guy probably won't read all the shit you're typing anyway, you have to take that opportunity. You just have to.  Finally, a word about your companion. Would you ever say to a girlfriend, ""Hey, once in a while when we pass each other in the kitchen I'd like you to knee me in the balls as hard as you can""? Of course not. She's there to make your life better, not bring pain into it. Wouldn't you have to be a little fucked up to ask for something like that? But that's essentially what she is asking you to do! ""Blinky, I'd like you to treat me less well than you are capable of."" And it's not helping you be the best person you can be. The best person you can be makes those around him feel happy and secure as much as possible. Her asking you to be an asshole is a symptom of something that she needs to deal with on her own, and it's certainly not something you should put up with.   So let's recap. Spineless sycophants and alpha as fuck badasses (AAFB) will actually do pretty much the same thing for their ladies: compliments, gifts, deferring to their desires, etc. But they do those things for completely different reasons. The sycophant sees himself as not good enough for the woman and is trying to entice her condescension. The AAFB has found a woman who makes his world a better place, and in return does everything he can to return the favor because he's a good person.  The bottom line, Blinky, is I don't know you. Maybe you're already an AAFB, in which case you just need to dump this bitch. But if you're trying to suck up to her, take some time to figure out why you feel like you even have to do that, fix that problem/problems, and then go on being the classy motherfucker that you are.

It's not too bad, I see her most weekends and it's always wonderful when we're together.  Most of the time, we text and talk on the phone and it's fine as long as things are going good, but it sucks when we're arguing.  Sometimes she'll text me these vague, foreboding statements out of the blue and then refuse to elaborate.  For example, she recently sent ""I feel like we never talk anymore.""  This is 5 minutes after sending me a lovey text about how much she misses me.  Then, when I try to figure out what she's talking about she won't be any more specific.  It gets really old and sometimes feels like she's testing me or messing with me or something.

1ibc65,1ibc65,markofbuddha,"So I need your guys' advice.   Also, prepare for a wall of text  I've been dating this girl for almost 9 months now.  A couple weeks into the relationship she ""cheated"" on me, she didn't really cheat she just went behind my back and started talking to my ""best friend"" eventually they started saying stuff like ""we should get together and ditch our current boyfriend/girlfriend"" etc. but after those few weeks she cut it off. That's what she told me when she confessed it to me about a month and a half into the relationship. The only reason she told me is because my ""best friend"" and another friend that figured out were fighting and he was hinting towards it. (Sorta bothers me that's the only reason she told me)   Also, I had some nudes in my email from previous girls that I hadn't deleted, none were out there while I was in the relationship, I just forgot to delete them. She found out about them, and got upset, but it truly was an accident, so she forgave me.   She also lies, a lot. I've tried confronting her about it and she always says she will be 100% honest from then on, but eventually, she starts lying again, even small things that don't even matter!   Ok, this is where I need your guys' advice. So I'm on vacation for about two months in Mexico, and about half way through me being here, she starts asking if she can have dudes over or if she can hang out with them. I know I'm an overly jealous person, but whenever I ask her not to, she'll say stuff like ""you don't trust me"" and then ill bring up past things that has happened on why it makes it iffy for me to trust her, and she ALWAYS gets upset, even if I don't bring up past events, if I don't let her hang out with dudes, I mean I want to let her hang out with them, andost of the time she wants to hang out with my friends (she has a twin and I think she prefers guy friends or gets along with them better).  Ill let her, ill just be like ""I guess it's fine"" and she will sometimes not hang out with them.  Also, she smokes weed and drinks and sometimes while on weed she will flirt with other dudes right in front of me! (So it seems like it)  And then I don't want her getting drunk with other dudes cause she gets super horny and flirts with other dudes as well! I've tried confronting her about it but she usually ends up being upset that I don't trust her.  I've told her how she acts when she does this stuff, and she apologizes but then just does it again! (Like the lying thing)   So I was wondering what should I do to make her not want to hang out with dudes as much? Am I being a jealous ass? And what should I do about the lying?

c3yxojt,qn5o3,sieghrt,"Sorry, I kinda stalked you from my friends' reddit list (since I added you as a friend).  I had the same experience before, though the relationship wasn't as short as one week. I used to like this girl a lot, like you we had things in common and we really talked and even spent a lot of our time being together in the college grounds. Her friends even befriended me and you know, I got my hopes up, even others believed that it would be us that time. (but you know, shitty things happen, which results in unexpected ways) Long story short, I thought things between us will become fruitful, but gah.. I tried avoiding her, but you know it was kind of difficult since we both study in the same institution and even share the same major. One good thing was that I had to take some time off because my parents couldn't afford my tuition expenses. I had to stop for almost a year. I used that gap of time just to move on and forget that girl, which successfully worked in time.  I think, the lesson here is that we shouldn't let our guard down and not to expect too much. When things backfire at us, it inflicts us more damage and makes it even difficult for us to move on.  You're still in high school right?

16m1d9,16m1d9,,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I just wanted to talk.   Last Friday I came back from a week holiday in Amsterdam. Before I went I was getting slightly jaded with life. I wasn't sure if I was on the right career path, and as such work was soul crushing at times. I was also in a relationship which I knew should be ended. It being so close to Christmas, I couldn't bring myself to go through with it. I just thought I needed a break, to rest my mind. So I went with the intention just not giving a fuck, getting high and drinking my sorrows away.   I stayed with my sister who goes to uni in utrecht and she let me know that one of her friends would join us for NYE.   My sister had work before hand during the day so I decided just to meet this girl before for some lunch. And fuck me was she beautiful. Not only that her character was amazing. We hit it off immediately. I tried my best to seduce her and on the topic of new yr resolutions I managed to get the smoothest line ""I suppose that if you're going to be good in 2013,tonight will be the last night to be bad."" ""yeah I suppose so, but I can't think of anything bad to do"" ""I'm sure I can think of something ;) ""   Well 12am came around and we were plastered. I went in for the kiss and she reciprocated.   Nothing much happened afterwards but we hung out the next day and after having a few more drinks I sealed the deal at her place.   I had no intentions of falling for this girl. My brain knew this could only just be a fleeting holiday romance. But then I spent the whole week with her. Smoking, drinking, and having sex. The perfect week.   I felt like a student again. I had no responsibilities and a beautiful girl on my arm. I felt alive.   Of course the week ended and I came back to my gloomy old life in London. I swore to myself that would be that. I knew there would only be tears if we were to pursue.   Well cue the post holiday depression. I hate the life I am currently living. I finally broke up with the girl I was seeing and when I thought there'd be relief I just felt empty and alone.   Despite what I knew what I should do, I kept in contact with the girl from amsterdam. I am a strong believer in relationship karma, and I know my next relationship will end badly for me.   Over Skype and im's we got even more emotionally invested. She kept telling me she was apprehensive of getting deeper. She'd be moving back to Korea next month and long distance relationships are no fun. I couldn't help myself though, contact with her was the only thing keeping me smiling throughout my day.   Yesterday though, whilst skyping she voiced her fears again. I decided that she'd be worth it and basically told her I was willing to work for it. I opened up but then she just replied that she didn't want to think about it now, even though she brought it up.   I realised then that she was quite immature. Maybe she just liked the attention I was giving her. What could I expect? She was still a uni student with her whole life in front of her. She must have other hopes and dreams to fall back on.   I decided then, maybe there was no point. I would make an active effort to forget about her.   And I feel shit. Life is dull once more. I can't see anything worth living for right now.

1lmk8c,1lmk8c,NoLuck175,"So there is this girl that I have a complicated relationship with. Lets call her K. So I had started liking K about a year ago, and we both had admitted to each other that we liked each other. But I was dating someone who lived far away (she broke up with me because we never really got to see each other). And about a week or so after we broke up, K and started to talk over the phone about every day until around 2 am. So I decided to ask her out, she said that she wanted to but didn't want to have that come up in her therapy the next day so it was a no for the moment. I was ok with that and didn't ask her about it for a while. Then after about a week she asked me if I still liked her and I said yes. Then K told me that she said yes to another guy (who is a complete jerk). This put me into a bit of a depression but it help that we still talked all night like we did before and she would complain about how they fight. ( it made me hate the guy she was dating). So they broke up about a week later. And he would still try to get back together with her. ( just to add he told K that he loved her the second day they started dating, creepy right?) so after a while I asked her out again and K said no but secretly it was a yes. So after that I would ask her just about every day. And all K's friends kept telling her to say yes but she would always tell me the same thing. After about a month I learned that K had about 5 or 6 guys who liked her and had asked her out, she said no to them as well so I started to think that she just didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by dating anyone. So I still asked her out until one night that she said she didn't like me. It hurt but the next day she fell asleep on my shoulder and she told me that she really did like me. After that we had hung out a few times and I would ask her out as a joke but sometimes I was serious and would give her a rose or say it in a way that made it really romantic, but she still had the same answer. Then over the summer K started dating another guy (this time not that bad of a guy) and I got very depressed. So I decided it was time to try and get over her. I told her (in a nice way) that I wasn't going to talk to her because I needed to not like her. I did that for about two weeks. And every day K would call me at least 4 times a day, and I would never answer. Until my friend had told me that she had tried to kill herself. And that night I called her and yelled at her while I was crying because she promised that she wouldn't hurt herself because of me, ( she had cut herself when she told me about the first boyfriend because she was scared to tell me) from then on we still talked and later she broke up with the other guy. But the other guy got really creepish to the point that if he went on school grounds, the officer at my school would arrest him. But now K and i have hung out two other times, both ended with one of us kissing the other on the cheek. So I decided to finally ask her out again ( I had asked her in Norwegian because that is her first language) and she never answered me and now she has told me that she isn't meant to be in a relationship. I still really like K but I just don't know what to do anymore.",relationshipadvice

l4hs7,l4hs7,gxslim,"Hello RA.  Posting this half out of frustration with and half out of concern for a good friend of mine. **TL;DR at the bottom**  **The background:**  I introduced my friend (let's call him Neil) to a female friend of mine (let's call her Kim) about six years ago. They became bf/gf and have been since then. There have been lots of bad times, and I'm ignorant of any possible good times.  She's cheated before, resulting in an aborted pregnancy. That was not her first. She's repeatedly dropped out of college or changed focuses, and hasn't worked any kind of real job, continually procrastinating on her education/career. We're all 28-30, so she is significantly behind. He has been supporting her and her family to varying extents this whole time. This includes bills and even her brother's tuition.  **The Build Up**  Back in July Neil, myself, and another friend drove down to Baltimore for Otakon. When we were there we met some girls that were pretty cool, and ended up hanging out with them most of the weekend. Neil hit it off particularly well with one of them (let's call her Jen). On the drive back to NYC, Neil was talking about Jen the whole time. It got to the point where he was obviously crushing on her, and given the history mentioned above, I advised him to reassess his relationship with Kim, without considering Jen in the process. Basically I wanted him to realize the distinction between ""break up with Kim for Jen"" and ""break up with Kim"".   **The Plot Thickens**  Well, after a few days, Neil texted me and said that he called it off with Kim. Needless to say I was relieved by this. Then he mentioned that he was driving back to Baltimore to meet up with Jen. I was a little bit off-put by this, hoping there would be at least some Neil-time in between, and worrying that he would just jump right into another serious relationship without taking all necessary precautions. Well, lo and behold, he ended up in a relationship with Jen almost immediately. And they fell hard for each other. A few days later he texted me again and said Kim's pregnant... *DUH DUH DUHHHHHHHH!*  **Where it gets weird**  From the start I suspected something fishy about the pregnancy. Kim was behaving very oddly about it. She kept putting off visiting planned parenthood with the flimsiest of excuses. She claimed that she miscarried but then took it back. I'm not sure of all the details, but it seemed an awful lot to me like she was going to use the pregnancy to try and keep Neil. I advised him (this'll get me downvotes) to get back with her, pretend everything is ok, but make DAMN SURE she aborted, then get out of dodge.  **Turning Point**  Well, needless to say, Neil did not heed my advice. He tried for about a day and then couldn't take it, broke it off with Kim again and ran right back to Jen. Keep in mind, this entire time Jen had full knowledge of the situation and had been showing the utmost patience. She gave him the option to put their relationship on pause for a few months and figure out his situation first. Also it bears mentioning that Jen is only 20, but working two jobs to support her own education and help her family.   **Present day**  Well, it has now been about three months. I have no idea if an abortion is even an option still, but it hasn't happened yet. Neil posted on his facebook that he is back with Kim working things out and it is none of anyone else's business. I fear that he is going to marry Kim just for the baby, and the baby will end up being raised in a horrible loveless sham of a family, the kind that I grew up in, causing me great depression and suffering for my entire childhood. I don't know what to do with him any more. I'll be talking to him later today, and I think I may just state how strong my feelings are about not raising that kid in such a family. I'm honestly considering disowning him as a friend if he does that.  What do you think Reddit?  **TL;DR **  **Friend's ex revealed her pregnancy after he got a new gf, procrastinated abortion for three months, possibly using the child to blackmail him into being a financial provider for her and her family. **  **UPDATE:** **Looks like Kim gave Neil an ultimatum: Stay with her or she will refuse to abort. Right now he's staying with her, but I'm hoping it is just until the deed is done. I believe this weekend is the surgery**",relationshipadvice

(We have been together for almost 2 years now) We moved to the same city together for university 2 weeks ago and have been seeing each other ever since (visiting her place). However, I'm finding that she seems more and more distant from me. Less talking, no hugging, no kissing and definetely no lying down together. She says she still likes me but doesn't seem to act that way.  During our 4 months apart (we both had co-op but in different cities), we texted each other everyday and skyped every 1-2 weeks. However, in general, it was always me doing the calling / texting. I accepted this as part of her character as she's generally quite shy and doesn't like showing her feelings.  Tonight, I finally cracked. After two weeks of being together in the same city, she has yet to show any affection. I know she's not cheating on me and she says she still has feelings for me. I asked her what was up and why she was acting so cold.   Her reasoning was mainly that she's used to being alone (for the past 4 months, she lived alone in an apartment) and that she doesn't really want to do anything intimate anymore (few hugs, few kisses, no lying together in bed).  So I guess to sum it up...after 4 months of being apart, she claims she still likes me but no longer wants any intimacy and hardly talks to me. I've been with her happily for a year and a few months.

I will be able to provide a great life for myself and those in it as well as being flexible enough to change when the need arises should life throw a curve ball.  I have a good head of hair, a dick any girl would be happy to ride on, and a need to be intimate(cuddling, snuggling, spooning, etc) with the girl I'm with.   I don't drink, so I don't frequent bars, there are no coffee shops where I live, and I don't go to church. I have several dating profiles, with which I have had exactly 2 dates from over the past 10 years, and maybe a little over 20 replies to messages sent to others on those websites with whom I would be interested in dating or seeing if we could have any chemistry.  No girl has ever sent me a message first.  Without trying to make this to much longer and risk loosing those who might try and offer some sound advice, as a mathematician I know there are girls out there who would like to be with me but as a realist I am wondering more and more if I will ever find one.    I'm tired of being friend-ed by all the girls I meet.  I would much rather be fucked and forgotten then friend-ed one more time.  It is frustrating to always be stuck with girls with whom I stand no chance with but get along so well with.  Is there anyone who can relate or maybe even give me hope?  Should I give up entirely, or continue wondering if and when I will find someone?  Or maybe a nice girl will read and be interested in finding out more.",relationshipadvice

After two weekends of going out with her girlfriends she's going to realize you're a dead-weight suppressing her fun.

faqag,faqag,,"Hi /r/relationshipadvice  This is a throwaway (duh), cuz my SO knows about my usual account.   Okay... so I have been dating this girl for almost a year, we'll call her ""Mary"". Well, recently some stuff has been changing in my life, most importantly, I graduated, my parents are moving away to another city (work stuff) and I have been getting lots of job offers; these things have made me stop and reflect about my current life situation and wonder about my future.   So, I started looking at my relationship with ""Mary"" and I realized that although we connect emotionally, we do not connect intellectualy and we do not share a lot of life expectations, for instance, I am always trying to improve myself by taking language courses, reading books, exercising, getting updated on recent events and advancements, I have a clear vision of what I want out of my life and thought of ways to accomplish those things. Mary, on the other hand, seems to just be breezing through life, she does not concern herself a lot about becoming better and better, for example, I am bilingual, Spanish being my mother tongue, and I have insisted like hell that she should practice English with me (she sucks at it) but she always turns me down, I even tried speaking to her only in English and well, that didn't work either.   It also worries me that she is sick most of the time, she constantly has headaches, she gets dizzy a lot, she can barely go up 3 stories without losing her breath, she gets her colon irritated a lot, her blood pressure drops down constantly (and no, she is not pregnant).... it is so bad, sometimes I ""jokingly"" tell her that she was poorly assembled in China.   The relationship seems to have halted progressing for some time now. I had never found conversations with her interesting and now it is even worse, to the point that sometimes I beg the universe for her to not call me, cuz I know it would just be trivial random stuff about what each other did during the day. She doesn't have anything interesting to discuss and when she does, it is usually poor material and I end up ""winning"" or taking over 98% of the discussions with facts and actual references.   Also, by now I should be feeling love for her, but I don't, I care deeply for her, but I know it's not love and most of the times I am not even willing to go out of my way to do stuff for her. I feel like our relationship has hit a dead end and we are no longer making each other better, I do not see myself marrying this girl and she probably doesn't see herself marrying me, and I feel kinda guilty cuz even though we care deeply for each other, this doesn't seem to be leading anywhere.   Anyways, ""Mary"" does have a lot of great stuff, she's beautiful, caring, her love for other livings things is amazing, she's so nice, honest as fuck, the sex is AMAZING. Because of all this and much more, I'm afraid I might be on the verge of destroying a nice relationship. I want to break things off with her, but I don't even know where to begin. I feel like I don't have a ""tangible"" reason to break up.   Sorry for the big ass rant, guess I just needed to get some stuff out.   Have you guys been in similar situations?

In the beginning we had a lot of fun and I really enjoyed life with her in it. After around the third month though, my feelings began to change about her and the idea of furthering the relationship. Without going into graphic detail, let's just say that the intimacy between us stopped. Soon resentment began followed by bickering to the point that I felt it needed to end. The issue is that she is very distraught over the breaking, and so although it pains me greatly, I have tried my hardest to have broken contact with her, at least for the time being...until last night. She text me say ""I left something on your front porch for you. Merry Christmas"". I get home to receive a monogrammed money clip, and limited edition flask, socks, and some weed.

ke6rf,ke6rf,,"I am 28 and since 6 months ago I have a 22 yo girlfriend. She is my first girlfriend ever; she has had a long-distance relationship before that she broke off after 4 years (2 years ago).   ** Back story: ** Since ~3 months we have spent every day and night together and also been on a short vacation. We're don't share many hobbies, but we're emotionally very compatible (clingy and hopelessly romantic), we can talk about things I had never thought I would feel comfortable talking about, and we haven't managed to get on one another's nerves despite spending at least 12 hours a day together for months. At the beginning she was a virgin and was determined not to have sex before marriage; but she changed her mind and now we're both enjoying sex very much. Her parents were not happy about us sleeping together (they are immigrants with a very conservative view), but they have said that they will support her no matter how she wishes to live her live and that they like us both. I get along great with her parents, and she with my family. Financial stuff: her family is poor and she is a student; I am rich (which I don't show, and although she knows that I am doing well, I don't think she realizes *how* well); she is frugal, and always insists on paying for herself.   ** Problem: ** She has basically been living at my place for the last 3 months. She has been dropping hints about getting engaged for a very long time, and we talked about it a few times, which usually ended with me ""buying"" some more time. Yesterday she finally said that she couldn't go on like this, that she finally wanted a place that she could call a home, and told me that she wanted to either separate or officially move in with me, and get engaged (not necessarily marry in the short term). I said yes to the latter.  ** Help, Reddit! ** Now I am slightly freaking out. I love her, I know she loves me, and I know that I couldn't stand to lose her. But am I moving too fast?

7w93l1,7w93l1,ProcrastinatorKenny,"Let me give some background. My parents are divorced. In the past, my mother had majority custody of me, and I had visitation time with my dad every other weekend and every Wednesday night. My mother...lets just say that she has a very extreme temper, like she'll start beating the shit out of my two younger brothers (6 years old, not my dad’s children) because they're being a bit too noisy with their toys. Shit like that, physical and verbal abuse, was at least a bi-weekly occurrence, with verbal abuse happening more than the physical stuff. Then, an extreme event happened during the evening of 11/28/17 that made me have a breakdown and I texted my dad to get me out of that living hell.   Now, since 12/15/17, he has had some legal custody of me. She got a lawyer to fight back against that. Now, last Tuesday, the judge ruled that custody would flip from what it was, where now she gets me every other weekend and every Wednesday night, despite everything I have said and written about everything she has said and done and how I'm actually scared to be alone with her based on all of that. Visitation is supposed to start tomorrow. My dad has been trying to fight that ruling from the judge, but the judge is on her side. He holds me back from seeing her, and he'll either go to jail or get severely punished.  What can I legally do that would not get my dad into any trouble?

A contractor with that company had his contract expire at the end of the year, and it was not renewed, so that contractor asked me for a recommendation on LinkedIn. I gave him a positive recommendation; I mentioned the things I feel he did well, and did not mention things that I think should have been done better. When I made the recommendation, LinkedIn asked me about how we knew each other, so I indicated that we both worked at that company, and what our working relationship was at the time (""worked in the same group"").  This was about a month ago.   This morning the owner of the company texted me asking me to remove the positive recommendation, because ""it's untrue"". I told the owner that I didn't feel right doing that, as I believe what I wrote IS true. The owner replied that he disagrees, and that the contractor is now suing him (it's my understanding that the suit is about the owner refusing to pay the contractor part of the monthly set amount for the final month of the contract). He wants me to at least disassociate the company from the recommendation.  1. Is what the owner asking me to do legal?  2. If it's not legal and I decide to do as the owner asks (which I'm not inclined to do) would I then be doing something illegal? 3. Am I doing anything illegal?  Note: I'm not in the legal industry.

3qc5q2,3qc5q2,NYCaptThrowaaawyay,"Hi there!  There's a bit of a complicated story here, I'll try to keep it short but I think most of the details are relevant.  My girlfriend and I leased a 3 bedroom apartment in OCT 2014 with an old friend [roommate A].  We are all on the lease.  We split the initial security deposit three ways.  6 months in, roommate A, who was a recovering alcoholic fell way off the wagon, and basically self-destructed.  Quit/got fired from his job, had no prospects, it was looking dire.    We all three agreed that he should probably move out (in fact we proposed the idea to each other at the same time, we did not force him out at all).    In a stroke of luck (or so we thought)  another old friend [roommate B] was hoping to relocate to the area, and so he and roommate A made a verbal agreement that he would ""take over"" his part of the lease.  They were clearly not trying to sublet, and never notified the landlord of the change.   At this time, roommate B wrote roommate A a check for his portion of the security deposit.  Roommate A promptly cashed and spent this, as he had no source of income at the time.  Roommate B is a terror.  Constant bickering, picking fights, never replacing things, etc etc.  Bad juju, we all start to resent each other.  Fast forward 6 weeks, and B tells us he is leaving, with 9 days notice until the next rent check is due.  He got a ""sweet deal"" somewhere else, and ""has no choice"".    After two weeks of intense arguing, fighting, and yelling, he leaves, and we somehow get him to pay for the following month.  He demanded that I pay him back for the deposit check that he gave to Roommate A, since I was ""taking over"".  I never received money from Roommate A at any time.   After he left it continued and it got to the point that I had to file a police report on B for harassment after he threatened to use his keys (which he kept when he left) to come into the apartment when I was at work, trash the place, and harm my dogs.  We opted not to try to find another roommate (after those two, who can blame us?), and instead began paying for the entire rent of the apartment ourselves for the remainder of the lease.  For the last month's rent, we opted to pay only our original share of the rent, and have the landlord use roommate A's deposit for the balance.  The landlord at first was fine with this, but as of today roommate A is trying to claim his entire share of the deposit, and leave us liable for the balance of the last month's rent.  The landlord does not want to proceed until we have this sorted out, of course.  I don't think he has any case here, but the more I learn about the law, tenancy law in particular, the more I realize you can inadvertantly screw yourself with seemingly innocuous actions.  So, /r/legaladvice ,  how screwed am I??  edit:  I realized I forgot to mention that I never paid Roommate B for his ""deposit"", since in my eyes that was between him and Roommate A.  Both have been harassing me for weeks about ""returning"" this deposit that I never had.",legaladvice

rq692,rq692,,"Throwaway account.  Sorry this so long.  My boyfriend and I, (I'm a female and we're both 21), have been together for almost seven years now.  We've always considered ourselves to have that great mixture of being best friends, lovers, support systems, etc, etc.  Things have been great for the majority of our relationship (no serious fights, no serious issues).  He's always been the sensitive one of the relationship; he's very close with his family and he'll cry at anything remotely sentimental.  This is all completely fine with me, and I have been willing to be his ""rock"" for all of these years.  I am a strong, independent, and stable female and it is something that really connected the two of us from the beginning.  This sort of opposing chemistry that we have.  A few months ago, I had to move from our hometown (about 7 hours away) for a great work opportunity and in order to continue my education.  He has stayed in our hometown so he can continue his education.  We have progressed into this long-distance relationship that has really taken a damper on him.. negatively affecting our relationship.  As I've mentioned, I am much more independent than he is.  I'm not the type of person to sit around and sulk because something is not working out.  It has been obvious to both of us that my reaction toward this LDR is much less ""dramatic"" as his.  He has been jumping to conclusions that I have this second life that he is ""going to find about"" and has been continuously threatening to end our relationship so he can find ""a hometown girlfriend."" He is constantly taking things that I say and turning them around into something totally different.  Every little thing that I say, he claims that I am making ""excuses"" for why I am so unshaken about this relationship.  I can take these things.  I try to understand where he is coming from and I am completely understanding toward him about it.  After talking about it, he has been claiming that he is sick of being the ""girl"" and wishes that we could have a stereotypical relationship (with the girlfriend constantly complaining about the distance and calling all the time, and the boyfriend consoling her).  I've told him that, emotionally, we go about things differently, and some things that bother him don't always bother me.    We've seen each other once a month since I have moved here (about 5 months ago) and text each other constantly.  Due to conflicting schedules, it's difficult to find time to Skype and he blames this on my ""double life"".  With school and work, I have no time to have a double life (let alone even have a life).  So, guys, what do you think?  Is this worth putting up with?  Should I continue to be his ""rock""?  I don't want to be considered the ""man"" of this relationship and, frankly, I think he's insulting himself by saying he's the ""girl"".  I love him but I've come to assume that he can't take this temporary LDR.  He has pushed himself to the breaking point and I'm afraid he's going to push me away as well.  **tl;dr: Seven-year relationship, recently turned LDR, could be going down the tubes because of his dwindling emotional well-being and constant accusations**  [edit: confusion]",relationshipadvice

A few months back, he gets a job. Cool. I thought things would get better.   No. I ""lend"" him my tax return to get a different car (Because I'm fucking sick of driving his), he does. So what does he do? He takes the door stripping off of my car because he was the one who put it on and that makes it ""his"" somehow (despite the fact he wasn't working at the time and it was paid for with *my* money.)  He arranges to sell his old car, and instead of cash -- HE WANTS FUCKING WINDOW TINT.

First of all, if the children are minors (under 18) they have no ability to file any sort of suit.  Their parents would be the ones with that ability.  And since it's the parents who have asked to keep the two apart, it seems unlikely that they would attempt to sue the school for enforcing the parents' wishes.    Secondly, even if the two are no longer minors, the school is within its rights to take steps which reduce disruption of the learning environment.  If the two are talking during class or otherwise causing each other distraction, the school absolutely can forbid the two kids from interacting.  Look, you're kids, not star-crossed lovers.

He has several broken bones in his face and elsewhere and will have to undergo reconstructive surgery by a plastic surgeon.  The police (local small town RCMP detachment) aren't doing anything. Several witnesses have come forward and there is video evidence, but their justification is that the video isn't good enough to tell which one is guarding the door and which were beating up my friend, and they can't charge the person standing guard. I'm not a legal professional, but to me this sounds like aiding and abetting a crime.  It's been about a week and nothing has happened at this point. I'm slightly concerned there's some prejudice involved as my friend is Indigenous Canadian and our area has a problem with racism.  I guess my biggest question is what to do at this point?

It doesn't happen every time he drinks and I can't really predict when he's going to get mad. Usually the next morning we talk it through and he apologizes and says he will try to not get mad while drunk but it eventually happens again. Two weekends ago he got mad at me for ""ignoring him"" when he called at 4am and I was asleep. We argued for about an hour and then broke up. A few days later he realized he didn't want to break up, apologized, and then treated me like a princess for 10 days. I thought we were making progress but he just called me now and since I sounded funny when answering the phone (because I was chewing something), he assumed I was trying to hide the fact that I had another guy over. It's the sort of thing that when we do talk about it sober he'll realize how ridiculous it is but while he's drunk he won't listen to reason. I know the response to this sort of behavior should be to leave him but I don't want to give up on our relationship yet. When he's sober and 75% of the time that he's drunk he's amazing and truly cares about me. I want to have faith in that part of the relationship and try to work things out for the rest of the time.

Likewise, I could count on him to make allowances for me to recover from it. If your girlfriend has been depressed for a long time, then she should be fully aware of the fact that languishing in it only makes it worse, not better. She has to *force* herself to do something once in a while, as uncomfortable as it might be, or her body will just demand more and more sleep. Supporting her stagnation isn't good enough for either of you.  Try to find a way to let her know that you want to support her *in doing things with you*. It'll be difficult to word, but you know her best. Try to figure out how to make her understand that you want to plan things with her that will be fun for you both, and then make a point of planning a very low-key evening for the next day or two.

I notice her dog is huge and cross the street since my dog likes to whine and whimper when she sees other dogs and I didnt want to deal with it.  &gt;  &gt; Once I get to the otherside of the street, I noticed the other lady had crossed too - maybe because she didnt want any trouble with her dog as well - and I didnt wanna cross back to the other side cause I thought that it was ridiculous playing chicken like that in the morning hours.  &gt;  &gt; So as we come to cross each other on the sidewalk (BOTH DOGS ARE LEASHED), my dog and the other dog start growling at each other. As I bend down to pick my dog up, the other dog chomps down on my dog and picks her up by her hind legs. At this point my pug is hanging from this dogs mouth as I'm trying to pry the other dogs mouth open. The other lady was an older one and was just screaming at her dog to stop.  &gt;  &gt; Well, after i pried my dog free, i was too in shock to get her information (only got her first name and phone number) and me and my gf rushed my dog to the emergency vet where we got stuck with a $1200 vet bill. &gt;  &gt; Needless to say, the other party has since ghosted me, her only text to me was ""Hope the puppy is okay"" &gt;  &gt; Any legal advice on what I should do next?

That's all you need to cover your ass. You had an idea, went through proper channels before implementing it, got approval, and after you were given the okay you implemented your idea, at no harm to school equipment and rather at your own expense.   And this part doesn't matter:  &gt; About a month later, the IT person left, for completely unrelated reasons (something along the lines of finding a better job, nobody really knows where or what it was for).  A secondary issue is that your idea was a good one. A tertiary issue is that the hardware you provided to the school equipment at your own expense has since gone missing, and replaced with lesser, cheaper, school hardware. Somebody took your RAM, and it appears to be the new IT person.  So cover your ass first, get the original IT person to vouch for you, and then once that is assured, press the claim for theft of your RAM.  This all assumes you are being honest and candid about the situation. If you're leaving shit out in your OP that pertain to the claim of theft and vandalism, then you've just wasted our time and nothing I've said will apply.

dl5uupm,6rk2w0,thepatman,"&gt;  if one car rear-ends another, and pushes it into another vehicle, the 'middle' car would actually be held liable for damages, even though there was no negligence on their part.  That's not accurate.  Not at all.  In order for *anyone* to hold liability, it has to be proven that they did something wrong - either through negligence or direct action.  What happens sometimes in multiple-vehicle MVAs is that the middle car holds **some** liability because they stopped too close, or didn't brake/change direction after being hit, et cetera.  It's entirely possible for liability to be split in a case like this.  Which goes back to what I said before - the victim can't go after NJ Transit until or unless they cite to something they did wrong - either via negligence or action.  Based solely on this narrative, the liability rests fully with the person who hit the bus.

I just severed ties with my psychiatrist a few months ago due to them repeatedly canceling my appointments at the last minute (or leaving me waiting 90 minutes past my appointment time) and then charging me $100 missed appointment fees. Then, when I told the office I was ending my care with them, they sent me a letter firing me from their practice, effectively barring me from seeing any of their therapists which sucks because they're the biggest mental health conglomerate in my area AND the practice my other physicians always want to refer to first.  I would suggest doing the following things which helped me:  1. Find a psychiatrist in private practice who accepts your health insurance if possible. Depending on your insurance, they likely have a list on their website of psychiatrists they cover. 2. File a complaint against your current psychiatrist with your health insurance company about the multiple visits where you've been shorted on time. If you can write up dates and times of your appointment, that would be helpful if your insurance decides to investigate them. 3. File a complaint with the state licensing board. If he's treating other patients with the same lack of focus he's giving to you, he may already have other complaints filed against him.  Good luck!

Isn't being with someone else, the opportunity to grow, experience, and learn about each other?

People don't want to get in relationships to be fixed, they want to be in it, to grow. You don't need to kill yourself, that's just silly talk. You just really need to go out and figure out, besides a relationship, what would keep your interest and go from there.

When she got back to school, she hid the fact that she showered with her housemates (3 guys, 2 other girls) in their bathing suits. We were still together when this happened but she told me when she broke up with me. She said that she needs space and time to think, although I've tried contacting her once a day after that. Some days better than others, but after about a week of doing this in between stuff, she finally told me she doesn't want to get back together with me because she's doing so well either working or hanging out with her friends not worrying about pleasing me by talking to me. She said she's has so much stress taken off of her shoulders. I understood that, but still wanted to try to work us out. She said maybe when she's done with school at the end of the semester. I don't knownid I can do that because of what she has probably been telling her friends about how much of a bad guy I am. I'm so heartbroken and she doesn't seem phased at all.

We have two possibilities then.   You were rejected because you didn't seem interested, to protect her feelings.  If you come on stronger, that indicates that you are **more** interested in a girl that likes you less. This is going to make her tend to reject you more strongly. (She thought you were playing her. Players want what they can't usually get. She turns you down, you want her more. bad call). She's going to feel justified in rejecting you.   The other possibility is she rejected you for some other unknown reason.  No matter what that reason is, it's like this:  You came on to her, she rejected you. Coming on to her more (right now) will make her less likely to be attracted to you.  HOWEVER- long term stable emotions in males are attractive to females. They want to be sure that what you have for them (support, attraction, etc etc) will not just be here tonight, but next month, and next year.

He's been working long hours so my only real opportunities to speak with him are about a few hour long windows of texting each day. Last night he got off work at 12, finally responded to me once or twice, and then never again. He had work all today too, but he didn't bother to say anything to me this morning or during the breaks I know he gets during the day. I've basically told him that I expect him to either kiss my feet and beg for forgiveness for what an asshole he was (not going to go into details, but the issue was completely his fault, and i'm not just saying that) or to end it. For some reason, I don't want to have to take the blame for the relationship ending, so I've left it all up to him. But in the meantime, I'm miserable. It's several more hours before he gets off of work, and all day I've just been doing nothing, moping about the house and wallowing in misery.

cdbh1h8,1qc3du,Dragger200,"Okay, so here's the thing. In all likely hood, I don't think you're going to like what I'm about to say but that's okay.   Sievert relationship you have is important, understand that. However, you're 16, she's 17, religion isn't really something you need to worry about right now. When you're 26 and dating a girl that you're planning on marrying, the that's the time to have the ""how are we gonna raise our kids and what religion will they be"" talk. Now I'm not discrediting the relationship you're in now, because of you're age or any other reason. When I was young and in a similar situation as yourself I was faced with a similar problem. Organized religion wasn't really my thing (although u did have religious roots and retained my own faith on any given aspect) while my girlfriend as well as her entirely family were heavily religious people, and that was fine.   If anything understand this, you're at a point in your life right now where you're life really is YOUR life. I know that sounds repetitive, but essentially it means if you day someone you don't have to completely melt your life with theirs. My advice to you is to let yourself feel emotion and connect with this girl that you have feelings for, but don't invest everything you have into it. Statistically, yea your relationship will in all likely hood end because its a young (people) relationship, but that's okay as well.   Focus on being happy, and everything else will work out in one way or another. Just remember, follow the campground rule.

Eventually, he will build up a kind of ""immunity"" to the action that makes him unhappy, for lack of a better word.  Also, tell him that you're the woman in the relationship and that, if you were to separate, you would most likely get rights to the child. Tell him that hitting the child bothers you and that if he does it again, you'll reconsider taking him back.  Tell him that you wouldn't cheat on him. Tell him that you love him (if you still do, which I think you do). But also tell him that this is his last chance to make things better before YOU are the one leaving.

lomkg,lomkg,,"My gf and I have been dating for about 5 years, starting when I was 16 and in high school.  That is why now both of us are in college, and still haven't gotten engaged, because we figure we'll do that afterwards once we're out in the real world. Now we're completely serious and have always planned to get engaged about a year after graduation, get married afterwards, and keep on being a happy couple.  However, it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started realizing that this is a huge commitment for someone who has never been with really anyone else.  This is my first REAL SERIOUS relationship.  I have never dated around, or done the single thing in any of my adult life, nor did I really the first 2 years of high school where this would have been possible.  The problem is I know my girlfriend has no doubts about us, she is completely in love with me and knows she doesn't need anyone else, nor ever will.  All I can think about now is that I am extremely unsettled by the fact of never knowing what else was out there or could have been.  I'm not even saying I want to sleep around or anything, I'm just 20 years old, and don't know if I know exactly what I want in an adult relationship down the road, or what I exactly would want from my life partner, you know?  I'm still growing up and figuring things out for myself, now to try to decide on something so important and distant is completely ludicrous to me.    The problem is our relationship is great and I feel like an ass for even thinking of leaving to get a taste for the world.  We don't fight, we're in love, we're compatible, have fun, have great sex, and all that good stuff.  Yet I still can't shake the fact that if I continue in this path it will lead to marriage.  After 5 years, that's the point of continuing this right?  If I can't be sure that I want to marry her, then what's the point of continuing this relationship?  I used to think of these kinds of things every now and then, but after going to a few weddings, approaching graduation, and a few other factors, this is all I can think about.  Does anyone have any advice about what I should do or how to approach her with these feelings?  I'd love some help before I go crazy here.",relationshipadvice

Not in some sort of dating set up, but a yahoo chat room. He was funny, charming, such a cutie - &amp; we've stayed in touch ever since. Throughout school, college, failed relationships, everything. (Obviously, we'd have times where we didn't talk for a few weeks, bc well.. Life) He knows more about me than anyone I can think of bc I confided in him for everything. He was, in a sense, my rock. I never actually thought we'd ""meet"" so communicating, pouring my heart out, trust &amp; honesty came easy. - I assume the same for him. Last December (2012) we had both apparently had shitty days &amp; ended up checking in on each other after not talking for 3-4 weeks &amp; then decided THIS was going to happen. We were going to meet. He invited me to his company Xmas party, I had just gotten out of one of THE WORST relationships ever and had all my crap together with nothing to lose, so that next morning - bought my plane tickets. Skipping the time up until I arrived in DC - I can honestly say - seeing him, touching him, having him right next to me.. I fell in love instantly. We had so much fun. Showing me the sights, showing me where things happened that he'd told me about throughout the years etc. Shared our first kiss that night, so ""romantic"" he said he could feel my heart beat. Corny, but I like that stuff. Next night was the party &amp; here is where this goes... We had sex that night. &amp; I will never forget it.. There was so much passion in his face &amp; the way he looked at me, I'll never forget. After that trip we talked that we were ""together"" but didn't know what to call it 1500 miles away. Fast fwd, he visits texas - &amp; it's the same, romance, intimacy, passion, ""perfection"" and we make it official. 3-4 weeks later.. I'm pregnant.   He was amazingly calm, supportive, &amp; on board. Immediately made plans to transfer with his job, &amp; move here to be with me. I told him that I was open to talking about it - all options, bc I knew he had other life plans previously.  He shut me down, this was what he ""wanted"" etc. I visit there one more time before the big move, and again, even at 13 weeks pregnant.. Romance, intimacy, passion, and he tells me he loves me. I asked why all of a sudden now.. And he said bc it's not the same over the phone, text, Skype.  Makes sense.  Finally, he's here.. And I expect fairytales, unlimited intimacy, tons of romance - &amp; it had stopped. Completely. It's not like I'm huge and pregnant either. He moved here around 16-17th week of pregnancy, and I didn't start to show until maaaaybe 7-7.5 months? I always flirt, and make comments, and he must not ""get it"" However, he does get off to r/gonewild every morning - and I even caught him getting off to an ex flings photos early on &amp; talked to him about it. We'll go AT LEAST a month without having sex, and even then I feel like it's out of pity. I can hardly even get him to touch me playfully, or flirt, or even look at me. i know pregnancy isn't really anyones BEST look, but i didn't get this way alone. It hurts. I'm having his kid, I'm painfully in love with this man, have a desire &amp; want for him always, can barely keep my hands off him.  Yet, I feel like his roommate.  Recently I caught him looking at ex fling (fuck buddies) pics again bc she recently got engaged  &amp; had to ask him to stop - will catch him creeping up on her every now &amp; then. I'm starting to think THIS/SHE is a large part of the problem. Maybe she's the ""one that got away?"" He tells me he loves me, but telling me, and showing me.. Different.

c2qo1gn,l7o7d,karmasutur3,"Think of it like this: You've a winning hand in poker. You know it. If you let the girl playing across from you know what you have, she's either going to beat you by folding, or calling your bluff cause she's actually got a better hand.   There are MANY ways to go about the dating game, but this one may help you. What you have to do is get get to 'bet' against you before you have bet. So you need to conceal your attraction for her. You need to get her attracted to you before you've given away that you are attracted to her. So you need to be able to get her attention without letting her know you are trying to get her attention.   There a literally millions of ways to do this. Game theory says you should use playful insults, and 'take aways' where you leave the girl thinking you don't really like her. Other theories have you act hard to get, or fake status or do things in front of her you wouldn't normally do.This sort of thing doesn't work for me, but it may for you.   I always liked doing a M. Shamalayan type move. I'd say something that seemed to be a mild come on, and then switch it around at the end so it seemed like they had 'mistaken' me . I find this to be a win - win, often because if they really think that I wasn't coming on to them, then they often 'notice' me and I can go from there, and if they think "" that was actually a come on!"" it's less threatening and conveys that i'm not an easy mark.   But I'm waaaay ahead of myself. You have two options: Figure out why what you are doing isn't working (difficulty: hard) or try something totally different, until you get a positive result (easier).   As far as the self sabotage, when you're doing something you don't know you are doing, it's hard to believe you are doing it, especially on purpose. It's that whole thing tho, if you remove what is impossible, whatever is left, no matter how improbable, is likely true.   It's painful to fail. It's much easier to not play than to lose.  If you've learned that lesson, then you've probably had more than a few years to bury it.   Confidence can be faked, but real confidence must come from victory. Unfortunately, that puts you in a 'fake it till you make it' place.",relationshipadvice
toxzf,toxzf,,"The story is: me and her have been together for 2 and a half years now and are both in college. However the last few months we've hit a point where we are constantly at each others necks arguing about anything literally, ranges from ""we hardly talk"" to ""I fucking hate you""   Each argument we both try at the end to come to a fair ground that is even, for example we had a two week break from college which was really meant for preparation for upcoming exams, I'm hoping to do medicine at university so I need to pay quite a bit of attention right now to studies but all the while, she has always been my priority. But I made it clear to her I need to work. She understood and went about her business as she would. We don't live together to clarify.  However soon later she started asking to see each other more than we regularly would, and with needing to work I objected with the justification being I need to focus on exams. Her responses would usually involve tears and dumping me, to which she'd later beg me to return.  We came to a compromise, I'd see her every other day for a couple of hours and this worked for a long while.  However in the recent weeks with exams starting things became even more hostile, we could hardly see each other as my exams were packed close and hers were spread apart, but I'd still make the time to see her, and she would do the same.  But one day I had just snapped, I came out of an exam and she phoned me, asking when I could come over. I said I won't be able to come till later, I have a workshop I need to go to for my exam tomorrow. She took this very badly, I won't go into details but it involved me going over to her place and ending the relationship on the spot. My explanation being we've changed as people who want different things and we don't respect each others wishes. I left and tried to forget about all the drama, but almost a week on now I feel myself missing her so much I feel like I over reacted due to exam stress and did something very stupid. I told her I don't love her any more because at the time that's how I think I felt. But now I'm not sure:( I don't know if I want her back or not, sometimes I think it's better to move on, sometimes I want to just go over to hers and grovel in the hopes she'll forgive me and take me back. I just don't know It doesn't help either there's a girl from college (me and my GF are at different colleges) who I'm becoming close too as friends, but I can't help imagine something more coming about it.

I have lost half of my life, if not more. I have lost a beautiful and intelligent woman, and a wonderful dog. I chose this path. Nobody else.  A part of me thinks I did it on a whim. But another part, much deeper down knows there was a real reason I did this. XXX is an amazing woman, and is many things, and has always been many things. But I don’t think she was my true future.  She was passionate, naughty, beautiful, sensitive and caring. But I didn’t love her like I should love my future wife and mother of my children. I want to be able to worship the ground my partner walks on, and lay down my heart for them to walk over. And with XXX, I felt completely the opposite. Like I was in control, like I was smarter, more successful, better. I want to feel inferior to my significant other. I want to worry whether or not I can keep up with them.  I cheated on her multiple times and pretended they didn't happen. She did the same to me. That was the start of the end of our relationship. It just took another 4 years for us to realise this.  Plus, XXX wants something else entirely from life. She needs to build something of her own in this world before she can truly share her life with somebody else.   I made many mistakes throughout the relationship, that’s for sure. I ventured elsewhere, I lost interest, I didn't pay attention or show love when I should have. I took my life for granted when I should have appreciated what I had. I have to fix myself to ensure I don’t do this again.   I spent 7 years denying what was plain to see. I spent 7 years ignoring my true feelings, that I knew it wouldn't work. That I was always looking for something more.  I cant afford to start again and again, repeating my fathers and grandfathers mistakes. I want to find the woman of my dreams.  My biggest fear tonight is that I wake up tomorrow and have nobody to turn to. Nobody to fill the emptiness. I don’t know who I am. I haven’t spent enough time alone to work that out.

c42hove,r2l11,RobotBuddha,"&gt;There have never been any hanky panky or attempts at it. Ever. The problem is that he doesn't take me seriously.  You're going to be the one who needs to make the first move. And frankly, it can't be a subtle one. I dated a girl who was about seven years younger, once. It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be to get over the mental hurdle of wanting to, basically, protect her from herself. That seven years might not seem like a lot, but socially it can mean a pretty big gulf. And nobody with any real moral sense wants to risk stealing someone's chance at really living their younger years to their fullest. Which to many people means ensuring they don't hook up with an older person who'll remove them, to an extent, from really living the 23 or whatever year old lifestyle. If he's a good guy, it's not something he'd take on with just a whim or possible light flirting. It's kind of a tightrope where it has to balance between ""Oh, she's serious about this and approaching it thoughtfully"" and ""Oh crap, it's a young person drowning in hormones who doesn't know what they're doing"".   All that aside, I had a lot of good times with the relationship I mentioned, even if it didn't last all that long. I even know a couple people with pretty significant age gaps in their relationships who've had it work for a very long time and seem far better off in it than a lot of others I know.   It's just a different kind of thing, but really, what do you have to lose other than a lifetime of wondering ""what if"". Regrets are far worse than potential embarrassment. Especially if, as it sounds, the pining might be interfering with other potential relationships.   tl;dr: It sucks, but you're going to probably have to really make a first move and make it obvious.

So to prevent that waterfall, a good strategy is to protect your job with FML, then accommodate with approval by working from home.   So they may want you to do this so your work nemesis, we'll call him Steve, can't demand to work from home because he doesn't feel like getting dressed.  ""But /u/legalthrowaway0801 got to work from home for the last [time]!""  ""Goddamit Steve, you're being a lazy asshole. /u/legalthrowaway0801 has been working from home because he/she is recovering from an injury""  ""Nope, I know, *for a fact* that they're just showing him/her preferential treatment. We have similar jobs and responsibilities, there's nothing that you have that states this was the reason, I want to take some brash and foolish actions that create a pain in the ass internal audit""  All because your shit wasn't processed through HR properly.",legaladvice

She obviously is looking for some cute/romantic moments and she feels like she isn't getting it from you.  If you love her and care for her, you will sit down and talk this out. It is natural to imagine scene's with other people, the important part is not acting on them. Try winning her heart back by acting like a kid again (overly romantic ideas and actions) after you talk things out. --- Edit: Overreaction or not, if you care for this girl you will try to understand where she is coming from...

I see myself being unhappy in the future as they say your sex life disappears.. and it already feels like I don't have one.   It's a passion/lust thing. I don't feel she lusts for me like I do for her. for 8 years I've made all the advances, we've spoken many times about it but I think I just make her feel like something is wrong with her. She truly tries to be into it, and I think she is to a degree.. But I always have to initiate.   I know she loves me and I love her. With all my heart. I just feel like everything became so comfortable and we're Best Friends, great roomates who sleep in the same bed, love eachother and kiss/hug.

Usually what would happen here is either the house would be sold to pay off the mortgage (equity goes to estate), or someone inherits the house and assumes the mortgage.   But OP would not typically be able to just inherit the house unencumbered. It sounds like there was a mixup somewhere down the line. OP - who was executor?? Normally the bank would be way outside of the SOL to collect from the estate, but it's possible OP and his sister assumed the mortgage by paying it for 6 years. However, the bank shouldn't have just assumed that; to approve someone to assume a mortgage they're required to check that person's ability to pay, for one.

I mean you like him, but is he the ONLY guy in the world you like?  This information only serves to inform us that he flirts with other people.   &gt;he asked if I'd come over and make out with him. I said no, because it was 1 am and I was looking awful in pajamas/no makeup etc  Well, it's clear he likes you more than friends.   &gt;The problem is this: for him, I think it would just be fun, and an 'experiment'.  Women get ENRAGED when men presume to know what they are thinking. Please don't do the same. Communication is a MUST. If you are worried he just wants to make out, or just wants sex, ASK him. Communication is SO important.   &gt; But it would mean so much more to me that I don't want to hurt myself by getting my hopes up and have them crushed when he turns around the next day and flirts with a hundred other girls  So you want to be with him, unless he wants to be with everyone. That's a totally valid and fair thing to want. So if you don't want to get hurt, you need to let him know this up front. Go over, hang out a bit, and bring it up. Let him know that you dig him too, and let him know whatever you are comfortable with, and also let him know that you're not interested in a guy who is going to date a bunch of girls at once.

I just went on a date with someone and hit it off fantastically. Hadn't felt that great with a woman in months. Then last night, I saw a post from (A) about her and her current SO. For some reason, this sent me into a spiral of missing her and missing my relationship with (B). I could maybe understand (B) since it's still a bit of a fresh wound, but why am I still thinking of (A) that way? How can I stop and move on with my life?

c2uecfm,lmgtw,lawnessd,"Different religious beliefs?  If that's the case, best of luck.  Let her know yours are different, and that once in a while you're going to make a joke about it.  Now, don't start bashing whatever she believes, but a joke here and there -- if she accepts and doesn't get pissy -- that means she's cool and worth the time.  Wait a little while before you test this, but definitely talk about it before you two get too emotional over each other.  Make sure she's not going to try to convert you (and you don't do the same -- convert or de-convert).  And that idea is definitely not too lame.  Fuck that.  I'm taking my girlfriend to one in the next week or two (I'm 26, and she's 24).  Granted, she doesn't know about it yet, but she'll be cool with it.  Why wouldn't she be?  Why wouldn't anybody want to go to a corn field maze.  They're awesome!  Just some advice: don't worry about what's lame or not.  Life's pretty lame.  Going to a movie on a first date's lame because you don't get to talk.  Thinking for more than 2 minutes and posting on reddit what a third date should be like is lame.  Going to a restaurant ahead of time to get a hostess to put flowers on a table for when you come back with your girlfriend -- as a romantic surprise -- is lame.  Going bowling's lame, rolley coasters are lame (especially if you say rolley coasters).  Going gaga over a pretty girl because she laughed at some of your jokes on a first date, flirted with you, twirled her hair, actually made a couple funny jokes herself that genuinely made you laugh, and then kissed you at the end of the night is lame.  It's all lame.  Life's fucking lame, and that's just the way it is.  If you can't have fun doing the lame things, you'll find yourself at a bar or club every Friday and Saturday evening, drinking, trying to meet women -- who you're just going to take out to dinners and tea-joints because everything else is too lame.  Lame is good, and the lamer the better.  Think about it.  If you act absolutely confident that some ""lame"" idea is going to be the greatest idea or greatest date ever, then she'll like you for being able to take something lame and making it fucking awesome.  Be the dork that you are and embrace lame.  And don't tell me you're not a dork because you went to a tea place and asked reddit what to do on a third date.  Awesome!  (And I'm not being sarcastic -- that's awesome.  Think Michael Cera).  By the way, I can neither confirm nor deny that anything I've said is valuable, not harmful, or good for any circumstance.

4ovl64,4ovl64,Pat_the_human,"I'll keep this short and sweet.  I was at a bar in Southern California...   After getting a beer, I was handed the checkbook. As I was standing at the bar (about 5 feet back from the actual bar it's self) signing my bill, a bouncer comes running past everyone, forcing and pushing people out of the way to get a drunk girl (who was puking) to the front. I'm assuming he was kicking her out.  As he was forcing people out of the way and dragging her to the front, he bumped into me, and the pen that I was using to sign the check flew out of my hand and bumped him in the head.  He became very aggressive, completely forgot about the other girl that he was ""escorting"" to the front, and screamed ""DID YOU JUST F****** TRHOW A PEN AT ME BRO?""   I exclaimed that it was an accident at that he should be less forceful of the customers who are just trying to have a good time... That pissed him off.  After I explained my side of the story as to why the pen hit him, he forcefully and grabbed my very expensive dress shirt, and essentially kidnapped me and dragged me 50 to 75 feet to the front of the bar... It was a LONG dragging. He then threw me out. I wasn't even pleasantly asked to step out and leave.  As he was dragging me, my cell phone (that I got ONE week previously) fell out of my pocket and not only did the screen crack, but the internals also broke completely - I don't have a working phone anymore. On top of this, my $600 shirt is now ripped at the collar and is destroyed beyond repair.  Since I was removed in this manner, I had no time to gather my things, and I left my card inside the bar. In order to retrieve my items, I calmly went to go try and go back in the bar to gather my things and leave peacefully.  Instead of letting me in to retrieve my card, the bouncer rage pushed me on my arm which has 6 metal plates and 6 screws and I fell to the floor and hit my head.  Today (on fathers day.... great) I checked myself into the hospital to get an x-ray of my arm and it turns out that the bouncer cracked the bones around the metal plates. Thankfully no surgery will be required and it will heal on it's own. I just try to baby my arm because I am a very skinny person and my ""bad"" arm could get worse if its damaged like this.    I called the bar this morning to speak to a manager or the owner to try and straighten things out, but they were not in.  Can I get some legal advice as to how to follow through with this? Did I do anything wrong? Can I press charges?   I honestly just want my phone replaced and my x-ray medical bills to be covered... x-rays are expensive and so are brand new $800 phones.  My friend who goes to law school was there watching the whole thing happen and he says that the bouncer was acting very irresponsibly and that he should have handled the situation in a more mature manner. It seems like the bouncer really just wanted to rage on people and hit them.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",legaladvice

1rwdkl,1rwdkl,Bneal63,"This is my first time posting to reddit so forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong. So backstory first. I'm a 17 year old male in high school who recently fell in ""love"" with this girl who I knew since the 6th grade. It hit me hard when I realized my feelings for her. One day we just had a deep conversation and then WHAM! In love. The only problem was she was currently in a long term relationship. She told me in our conversation that she knew that they weren't going to last much longer, so I figured I had a decent chance. So the flirting began. I eventually found out that she had feelings for me to (to my utmost joy). I told her how I felt and she said that she is going to break up with her boyfriend. So two weeks go by and we talk about how great of a couple we are going to make. I'm ecstatic at this point, I can't get her out of my head. She finally texts me one night and says she broke up with him, but he doesn't want to date just yet. I say okay I'll give you some time to go through that. Fast forward a few weeks she's at my house and we started making out (quite passionately I might add) I ask her to be my girlfriend. She says okay. Next day she says she thinks we should take it slow and not be boyfriend and girlfriend yet. I say okay I understand. Fast forward a few more weeks. She says she doesn't want a relationship AT ALL. I say why I thought we had something. She says she really does like me she's just confused right now. Hell I was the one confused, I was in love with her, I couldn't get her out of my head and now she's suddenly not interested. Well I found out that she wants to fuck some other kid and she was planning on doing it behind my back. Now I knew this girl for a long time, I thought she was super innocent. But no, she wants to fuck some dude just to lose her virginity to him. I was heartbroken, and still am. I know she wasn't worth it, but I feel like I lost something. She just felt right. Smart, pretty, funny, she took my breath away. And now she's going to fuck some kid for the lulz and didn't even care if it hurt me.

4fh9zh,4fh9zh,ijustwantedsomemms,"I posted this over in TIFU, but someone sent me a message and suggested I post here to get some advice - or at least see if this lady has a case.  This happened yesterday on my way back home from a business trip.    I was sitting in an aisle seat near the front of the plane eating some peanut M&amp;Ms when a lady comes out of the lavatory and yells ""what are you doing!?"" and kind of kicks my hand (not hard, but a hard enough tap that I drop my M&amp;Ms). She continues on and tells me ""You can't eat those! They made an announcement! I'm going to die! I can't breathe!"" This alerts the flight attendant who comes over and explains that the woman has a severe allergy to peanuts and she made an announcement at the beginning of the flight that they wouldn't be serving nuts and to refrain from eating them.  I'm mortified and I completely did not hear the announcement, so I apologize profusely and I'm picking up the M&amp;Ms as they are rolling around the floor like freed wild animals on the serengeti. The woman is still yelling and starts breathing heavy, like sucking in a lot of air and says she needs to get out of there. The flight attendant escorts her to the rear of the plane and asks her where her medicine is, but the lady just kept saying she couldn't breathe. Luckily we were beginning our descent so we weren't on the plane much longer, but as we're taxing they ask everyone to remain seated and the EMTs will board the flight, and they take her out on a wheelchair still gasping for air.  When we exit the plane she is right there in the waiting area and she's still panicked and telling the EMTs to take her to baggage claim. I go over to her and apologize profusely and asks if I can help or call anyone for her. She tells me to go away (in more colorful language than that). So I sheepishly walk away. And I thought that was the end of it...  Until last night I got an email in my work inbox from the lady threatening to sue me. I have no idea how in the holy fuck she got my work email, or what fucking excuse/defense I have other than - I no hear too good. At least I know she's alive, but now I'm freaking out that I'm gonna get charged with possible peanut homicide. My company doesn't have a legal department, so I'm wondering if I need to suck it up and shell out the money to get a lawyer to handle this. I really was not trying to be an asshole, and I feel awful for the lady. Or at least I did until she got weird and found my personal info.  tl/dr:  I ate peanut M&amp;Ms on an airplane. Lady with a peanut allergy found out my information as is threatening to sue me.  **UPDATE: Holy peanuts, Batman! Didn't expect this many responses, but thank you all for your input. None of my coworkers owned up to sending the email, so maybe they are going for the long-con. But to be safe, I forwarded the email to my boss and he said to do the same with any other correspondence I may receive from the nut lady. And, as someone suggested, we had our IT look at where it originated from - it wasn't internal, but could have still been from a coworkers home computer. But even if it was a real threat, it sounds like she doesn't have much of a case if she were to pursue it, which takes a load off my mind. On the plus side, a few of my coworkers thought it'd be funny to leave bags of peanut M&amp;Ms hidden throughout my desk and office - so win for me!**",legaladvice

cgklhgr,228voe,sorator,"^(IANAL, just applying some common sense.)  Hm. The fact that you spoke with a local attorney who ""said he did not know what to tell me to do"" is concerning. That *implies* those offices are correct in that there is no grievance system or legal recourse... but that seems very strange. If you can get another attorney to meet with you for a free consult (that isn't uncommon), do so; a second opinion is a very good idea here.  If, however, that is the case, and/or while you're trying to determine that, then I'd try the following:  First, do everything from here on out in writing. If you have a conversation in person or over the phone, take notes, and follow it up with a letter summarizing your understanding of the conversation. Keep copies of those notes and letters. If you do wind up in a lawsuit, you'll have documentation; if not, you'll have that to give to the media and other interested parties.  If possible, get the names and positions of everyone you speak with; write that down in your notes, along with what you say to them and what they say to you. It's a lot more effective if you can reference a specific person and a specific conversation, as opposed to being vague.  Ask the court clerk what they need from CSD to get things moving again, then ask CSD to send it over again - if need be/opportunity presents, commiserate with CSD worker over how court clerks always seem to lose important paperwork and how it's never CSD's fault these things happen... then ask them to send it again anyway *just this once*. Use their name when speaking to them. Avoid taking out your frustration on them - more than likely, this is not the fault of any of the individuals you speak with, but they may be able to do a little extra to help you out, so you want to sweet-talk them a bit. ^(Don't offer bribes, obviously.)  If the clerk won't tell you what they need, or CSD refuses to send it (you can try contacting them multiple times to try and get different people, one of whom might make an exception), or CSD says they sent it again and the clerk still says they didn't get it, or **whatever** - basically, if you've made reasonable requests that aren't working and you've documented that in writing, then your next step is to get other entities involved.  Contact local media - one of the news stations might jump at the opportunity for a story, especially if you've documented it well. Write a letter to the editor of your local newspapers. Also contact your state representative and senator (state legislature, not federal) - you have a problem, which you cannot resolve with reasonable requests, nor do you seem to have legal recourse. They may be able to put pressure on CSD or the clerk's office to resolve it, or they may be able to sponsor legislation to help address the issue (because chances are, you're not the only one in this situation). Look into any non-profits that may have an interest; it's a bit of an odd direction for a women's advocacy group, but it's worth checking. You might be able to get folks from TN interested as well, either their branch of CPS, their courts, or their legislature, but it's more of a long-shot.  Basically, if you can't deal with it yourself, and you can't seem to motivate the relevant agencies to deal with it, and if that lawyer was right and you can't get the courts to deal with it, then you bring in others to help motivate the relevant agencies to deal with it. And you keep working on it until it's resolved to your satisfaction.  Another long-shot is the possibility of checking if it got categorized as 'unclaimed property' - the easiest way to check that is to go [here](http://www.missingmoney.com/Main/Index.cfm) for the national system, or [here](https://www.fltreasurehunt.org/) for the FL specific one, and enter your personal info for a search. I highly doubt anything will turn up, but it is worth a shot (and it could turn up something unrelated, which is always nice).  I hesitate to mention it, but there *is* the option of asking your ex to pay you directly instead of through the courts. That definitely opens him to some significant risk - and possibly you as well - so I really wouldn't recommend doing that, but it *is* an option. If you're considering this, *definitely* talk with an attorney about what risks that would involve and how you can minimize them.",legaladvice

12k3zk,12k3zk,throwaway5898,"Some backstory: I'm 20, and there's this girl I like that's 18. She's one of my sisters friends and I've known her for the last few years now. My sister is at college now while I'm doing courses at a tech school nearby and working; this girl in question comes over almost once a week to help our sick/injury ridden mother with miscellaneous things. Anyways, my sister just texted me tonight out of the blue asking me if I had a thing for her. I did the casual ""well she's nice and all, but I don't know"" response, which is kind of untrue. She's actually pretty nice, cute, smart and witty, but how would I tell my sister that? Plus, I'm not quite the most ""charming"" looking guy in the world, and I have a constant fear of being classified as a ""creeper,"" so anything I say or do makes me think I'm nothing more. I was drinking at the time, but I couldn't help but think that she was texting her all the while this was going on, but at the same time I don't think so. I don't know, what to do, how to react to this and it kind of worries me because now I feel as if it's going to be awkward every time she's over and it's just going to ruin everything. I guess just wait a few days/a week to see what happens? What should I do?",relationshipadvice

e2d6n,e2d6n,,"Here's the long version: Several months ago, my fiancé had asked me over the phone to log into her Facebook account and check something for her. While I was checking that thing, she got a chat message from, let's call him Tom. Before I had a chance to inform him that I wasn't her, he said, and I quote, ""what up?"" ""missed you"" ""ditch your guy and let me show you a good time"" I promptly took a screenshot for proof in case I ever needed it, and forgot about it. This is a friend my fiancé had since they were little kids. I KNOW if I mentioned this to her, it would ruin their friendship. That's why I never brought it up. He seemed to be leaving her alone since then, so I thought it was over.  Today he sent her another message, presumably to get their friendship back since they've drifted apart. He wants to take her to the movies next week. My fiancé told me straight away so I know she's not keeping it a secret. I'm sure she has no idea where Tom's mind really is.  But here's the catch; I'm agoraphobic so I'm not going to be able to go with them, or go after them to spy. So I have to handle this with her since I'm not able to confront him about it or get in his face about it... or threaten him. And just to be clear... my trust in her is not in question. Tom is the one I'm worried about. If nothing else, him putting the moves on her at the movies would ruin their friendship, and I wouldn't want that. Not really.  So what should I do? I could show her the screenshot. I could tell her not to go out with him. Or I could do nothing and see what happens. Opinions? Thanks.",relationshipadvice

pd4z2,pd4z2,,"My friend is seriously dating a girl who I would now call a sort-of friend. By seriously dating I mean 4 years, House, dogs, families expect them to get married. He is great, really funny, with friends he's quite boisterous and confident while still being sweet- bit of a loveable asshole. I've known him for ages. They met, she pursued him and she's quite a lot older than him so him being the way he is, (believing this was the best relationship/only woman he could hope for) is subservient and is quite the 'whipped' boyfriend. She is fairly jealous, controlling and dying to have kids and get married. She's quite abrasive as well and his friends don't really like her, nor do his acting parents. She obviously has good qualities too, she's clever and has a great career, she was fun when I first met her, she has *great* legs. One night, she was out of town, he was going to meet her for a weekend away and I was going over to get the keys to look after their pets. He looked hesitant and on the verge of vomiting, dicking about trying to finish packing and finding the keys, so I sit him down make him tea- ask him what's wrong, he tells me how unhappy he is and how he wishes he'd said it sooner but that he loves me and wants to marry me, sex, babies, life the whole shebang etc. etc. I can't tell if he's saying he loves me because he means it or if it's just some way of getting out of this relationship so that he's not single and has a valid reason. Is he just afraid now of making the final leap with her?... He has sat in ridiculous relationships in the past because he was too afraid to leave the girl. I've been fooled into a relationship in the past in a similar fashion, married man claiming he hated his wife was afraid financially to leave. Liar. What do you think?

Think of it this way: if the smartlock was locked, and you suddenly died and the ability to unlock the smartlock lay solely with you and you alone, could another tenant or the landlord open that door with only their existing key?

As you go through your life, you're going to lose some friends, make new ones, lose some of those, and maybe gain some of the old ones back after a while. The #1 thing that will make friends -- even old, reliable friends -- change is falling in love. Trying to fight love is like trying to fight with gravity -- at most you can resist it for a while until your fuel runs out and then you crash.   Trying to chase the friends that drift or abruptly pull away is only going to cause you heartache or worse -- it's going to put you in situations that you don't want to be in. Don't let them pull you, don't fight against gravity.

c2vc7ac,lswpy,extremethrowaway,"Woman here. This could be very wrong, so think about it first, but here's my gut reaction:  She feels insecure from the first time you turned her down, and she is not completely confident that you know what you want and will pursue it with dedication.  It's possible that the best way out is to be clear and demonstrate that you are completely invested in how much you like her and want to start dating her. (If that's not true at this point, it might not be worth pursuing.)  Doing that will help her overcome her insecurity about being turned down and demonstrate to her your ability to go after what you want.

r6r61,r6r61,nonsensicalthrowaway,"So here's the situation. I've been friends with a girl, let's call Jean, who I met through a club at school. I've been more of a mentor to her for the majority of the time I've known her. Recently we started hanging out one-on-one, hooking up and I guess you can say we seeing each other.    Recently, another one of my friend from the club (who I can trust that his information is reliable) informed me of something that's kinda bothering me. He knows someone who happen to live by/hang out with Jean's ex-bf (they dated in highschool). And during a night of drunken nonsense, Jean's ex showed a homemade porn involving Jean and her ex doing the dirty deed with a bit of kink. The people who saw this then went on to tell a good deal of people about it, many who are also in the club.     Now, Jean doesn't know that people know about the video. And I'm kinda at a weird place. I'm mature enough to accept that Jean has had previous sexual partners, nothing wrong with that at all, we've all got our past. As long as there's no baggage things should be dandy right? But for some reason I can't stop thinking about what was in the video (it was described in detail to me, dialogue at what position and everything bleh) and even though I want to be able to say it doesn't bother me. It sorta does. I know that it doesn't mean anything since that shit's in the past, but I can't shake this feeling off.    I want to bring it up to Jean, I guess hoping that talking to her directly might help? Or just let her know I know about it, and I'm (kinda) okay about it. Maybe I'm looking for reassurance that it won't affect anything between us. But the rational part of my brain makes me think that nothing will really come out of this. Because she'll know that people know about it, and that'll be weird for her. In addition, I don't think she can really do anything to help the situation? Not like she can just go delete it from existence or something. I don't know, I get sick thinking about the video but for some reason I want to let her know what I know? This sucks.

faf4t,faf4t,whattodowiththiswetp,"Throwaway, of course.  I'm married to a guy for a little more than 3 years and bless his heart he tries, but sex is just not important for him. Every now and then he will be in the mood but he just wants to get me wet enough to stick it in and then about 3 or 4 minutes later, he's done. No mention of doing anything for me. He is not a dick, he is just oblivious. He doesn't even look at porn (seriously), this is how low his libido is. Sometimes I think he only ever does anything because he thinks that I expect him to. He's healthy, a little overweight but not hideously. He's not depressed. His plumbing works properly. He has children from a previous marriage. There's just something that makes sex not a big deal for him at all.  Finally today he got me massively turned on for the first time since we were first dating and I wished he'd play around a little more before getting to the inevitable finale, but hey you have to get it how you get it, right? But right before any penetration of anything occurred, he got distracted and his member lost all interest. He tried, you could tell he was spending effort to get his erection back but he just couldn't. He said something about having to blow his nose and I said ok, go do it and that was that.  I love him so much and our relationship is fantastic in everything but the sex. I'm in my early thirties (he's older, but with much less experience) and I am pretty non-demanding in this area but I do think I have a healthy, if slightly below average, libido. He's not interested in seeing me get myself off. I do that by myself and the orgasms are grand but it's not the same, you know? He's not interested in trying anything new. Any kind of games or things like that seems contrived and artificial to him. We have talked about these issues and what can be done about it, or tried, but usually he just ends up apologizing a lot and I end up reassuring him that a healthy relationship is a whole lot more than just sex.  But damn, reddit. I'm not going to walk away from my otherwise perfect marriage on account of bad to nonexistent sex, but the idea that a little pink vibrator will be my only satisfying nookie for the rest of my life gets me down.

You went for coffee, so if you actually take her to coffee, it's gotta be good. If not, you can totally dictate something else (equally non-threatening). When you call her (and it should be tonight or tomorrow at the latest) You must not be weak, or suggestive.   Don't ask her. Don't tell her. Just include her.   Good examples:   *  *ring girl, say hi. then: *  Let's go get coffee at *place*. Five pm?   *     *ring girl, say something funny. then:*  I asked you to coffee. I actually hate coffee.

So what are you doing saturday? oh, you're busy? what about friday? oh....I see. Ok then tuesday? Well just coffee.   Things to AVOID- You must have already chosen a place, and time, and backup plan, before you pick up the phone. It's not like you're finding out when she wants to go, it's like you are already going, and calling to let her know what time to join you. This doesn't mean you aren't open to any suggestion, you have NO ego about what gets done. But if you change your mind, it's because YOU approve of her suggestion, not HER approving of your suggestion. Get it?   You're already going to (whatever place). You invite her along. If she suggests a different time or place, you are allowed to approve. You are NOT seeking her approval.   Other things to avoid: It's thursday, the date should be friday, saturday, or sunday. Sooner is better. You're not desperate, you're interested.  If she suggests a time a long time from now, you're losing part of the battle. If she actually found you attractive, she'll move her schedule. IF she absolutely can't, and she found you attractive, she'll APOLOGIZE for being busy when she says she cant come, and she'll IMMEDIATELY suggest another time. (unless you do something stupid and interrupt her).    If she says she's busy, and can't go out, and doesn't immediately suggest another time, say ""Ok. I'll see you around then. "" And politely end the conversation cheerfully.   Do NOT suggest a date that is a long time from now, unless she's only free on like wednesdays or something.   Do not wait to call her. It needs to happen tonight if possible, tomorrow mid day is ok, but not as good. Evening is the best time to call, 7 pm or so. If you hit her up during class or work, it's added stress, or at least she has to pay attention to thinking about you, when she wasn't already. YOu want to try and call when she's already going to be thinking about you, which is going to be in her free time.   When you call her, be standing up. When you are talking on the phone, stand straight up, with your chest out, and speak a little more slowly than you normally would. I know this is going to sound insane, but just do it.   If she agrees to the date, but then starts trying to talk to you, TALK with her, but not for too long.  BE interested in what she has to say. after you've had a LITTLE conversation, say you've got something to run off to , and say you're looking forward to seeing her, and then go.   No matter what, at the end of the phone call, tell her in some way that you're anticipating the coming meet up.  Your attitude should be like when your buddy offers you a cold drink on a hot day. It's awesome, but it's just a drink. You're not super stoked, but it's cool.   ""Allright! Saturday at 6! Looking forward to it. see you!"" or ""Cool. I'll see you at the coffee house. Can't wait! (said casually) or  Tonight at 10. We'll be hoarse from discussing british lit over the soundsystem at the club.   whatever you do don't draw out the conversation, even if she tries to.   we'll take it from there.    *REASONS why you are doing all this:  *   Doesn't matter who you are, from Einstein to Mick Jagger- Confidence matters. Whether you can win a fight or do physics or whatever it is you are good at, you must DISPLAY confidence. Man or woman, confident people are already sure that the other person will like them: confident people are more interested in finding out if they are sure they like the person they are taking on a date.   You must have this frame of mind.   *   Also: Confident men attract lots of women and friends. When you have lots of admirers and friends, you don't end up bored at your house a lot of the time unless you WANT to be. Women know this from trying to get a confident man, and so they know when you stay on the phone for an hour chatting them up, that you either didn't have anything else going on, or you bailed on what you had going on. If you're bailing on what you had going on for a woman you just met, that's desperate. if you INCLUDE a woman in what you already had going on, that's interested.   * She feels the following ways toward you (if she likes you even a little, which we can assume from giving our her number as long as it isn't fake) - -She is curious about you -She's a little scared (you're a random guy, you could be Mr. Right, or a Rapist. ) -She's concerned that you're looking only for (insert something here, sex, relationship, etc etc etc) -She's unsure she actually likes you. I mean you were cute and all, but she knows NOTHING about you. -She's waiting for you to call. -She's hoping you don't do what (asshole ex) used to do.  -She's imagining that you are awesome, and not boring.  -She's wondering what you are going to do next.  **-She's wondering if she is a 'good' enough girl to date you. **  Read all that a few times, and realize she's probably thinking about this right now. So you don't want to do the following: Leave her waiting, Scare her, be creepy, lie, appear to be unconfident, appear to be overly sexual, let her know everything about you.   You want to keep her curiosity going, make her feel comfortable (you're not someone to be feared, right?) You're not just looking for sex, (actually you're just looking to be better at dating, a.k.a. be a better man, and that's a noble goal.), educate her that yes, she actually likes you, and you're not the same as other men.

cz7hmpi,420sdd,cld8,"&gt; Is the argument that they could be booking her on another job but she will be unavailable if she's 'working' for you instead?  That's part of it, but even if they don't book her on another job, they are missing out on revenue that you should have paid them, if you work with her directly.    &gt; What additional services would they possibly provide a second time around that would warrant another $20,000 fee?  The services are of course worth less the second time around, but that is irrelevant.  They have the right to set whatever price they want.  They still provide some sort of safety net if things don't work out.  For example, if the surrogate refuses to hand over the baby, you may have recourse against the agency.    &gt; Edit: I feel like this would be the equivalent of a matchmaking service that matches you up and wants to charge you per date. They paid a substantial 'finders fee' for the screening process. And yes, I know the contract signed says they agreed to this provision, but I'm just trying to reason out the logic here and how California disregards non-competes shows how some contracts are not enforceable.  A matchmaking service could do that if they wanted to, but of course they would not get very many customers.  A better example would be a music store that finds students for their teachers, and then takes a percentage of the cost of each lesson.  The teacher cannot just tell the student to come to his house for lessons instead and bypass the store.  This is generally considered enforceable, although of course the teacher could stop working at the store and then teach at home.  Similarly, if the surrogate mother decided to dump the agency, she could then contract directly with anyone.",legaladvice

3chz6s,3chz6s,SnoobaDiver,"Hey all! I (27F) just purchased a house in San Francisco and knew that I would have to evict my tenants so that I can move in. I was aware that this city is very tenant friendly but fell in love with the house and really want to get out of my current situation. I expected to pay just the relocation fees and minor legal fees as my worst case scenario (was hoping to pay much less since it's technically a SFH with an illegal inlaw but my lawyer said it's zoned as RH-3 so I couldn't just raise rent).  So I hired a lawyer to proceed with the OMI process (60 day notice sent on May 17th) and about 1 month after they received the eviction notice, they sent back a letter claiming that they're protected so they want an extra $3701 per tenant (2 of them). Their disability is psoriasis (for the man) and graves disease (for the woman). This brings the total relocation payment that they want to $18504. My lawyer has charged me $7500 so far just to send the 60 day notice and to tell me to pay the protected relocation fee because it would be cheaper than to fight it in court.  Before I bought the house, they signed a form for sections 37.9(i) and (j) stating that they are not members of the protected class. I asked my lawyers about this and they said:  &gt;Unfortunately, the disclosure documents that the tenants signed state that they are not a member of a protected class of tenants under Section 37.9(i) of the Rent Ordinance, not 37.9C(e)2. Section 37.9(i) applies to situations where a landlord cannot evict a tenant who is disabled and has been living in the unit for 10 years or more. Here, your tenants are claiming they are disabled according to the applicable definition in 37.9C(e)2, which is much more broad. So, hypothetically, a person could fail to qualify as “disabled” according to the standard in 37.9(i), but could qualify as “disabled” according to 37.9C(e)2.   I'm scared that I'll pay them the relocation fee and they'll still stay in the house after July 17th, so I'll have to pay the relocation fee and a high lawyer bill to evict them in court. The fee is already almost a month later than demanded in the letter because we requested evidence which took them a couple weeks to send - consisting of articles stating that their diseases lead to depression.  I'm extremely stressed out and crying a lot lately because of this and don't know where else to turn. I don't trust my lawyers and asked them to stop working on my case without consulting me about any fees they want to charge because the invoice ended up being 5 times what I was promised. What can I do in this case? Should I just pay up the extra relocation fee and cross my fingers that they move out?  **TL;DR** - Trying to do an owner move in eviction. Tenants claiming disability because of psoriasis and graves disease to bring the total owed to them $18k. Lawyers (already costing me far too much) say just pay up because fighting in court will cost way more. I'm afraid they won't move out even if I pay up because they seem vengeful and I'll have to pay high court costs anyways - so why give them an extra $7.5k? What do I do? :(",legaladvice

3hg6ud,3hg6ud,Worried1987,"Hello LegalAdvice.   Today is my daughter's 3rd birthday. When she turned 1, her father (whom I've never been married too, lived with, or share any assets with) decided to move away from us to Florida.  We never created a parenting plan or had anything legally set in stone. His name is on her birth certificate, though. He would pay me here and there depending on what he could afford and I never asked for more ever. It seemed civil to me and he was ok with seeing his daughter one week every couple of month.   April of this year, everything changed. He told me he wanted more time with her and that he didnt feel it was fair I had more time than he did. (Um.. hello? You left to Florida on your own and left me as a single mother for the most part). I have since been married with my new husband now for a year and because he is in the Military am unable to just up and move to Florida so he can see our daughter more. He also told me he is unwilling to move from Florida back to Missouri to be closer to her. And decided that since it was not court ordered he was not going to pay me any 'child support' until he got a lawyer.  I felt a lot of this was out of character and intimidation but it still freaked me out so I told him I didnt feel comfortable with him taking her without my supervision because with no parenting agreement he could literally take her away and never bring her back and its not kidnapping since there is no court order in place. That scared me so I told him he needed to hire a lawyer to get everything official before I felt comfortable with him being around her.   That enraged him and he told me he wanted a paternity test and that he wasnt sure if she was his and that if she was not biologically his than he would sue me for emotional damage and all the money he paid for her in the last couple years.   This was all this past April. Since he sent me that message I did not speak to him again because he made me too anxious.    I did not receive any money or word from him whatsoever and was 100% okay with this. I know the law in Missouri, if one parent does not pay child support or visit the child in 6 months then you can petition the court for that parent to lose parental rights. I was just watching the clock.   Today is her birthday and I finally heard from him saying he has paid $5500 and finished all his ""preliminary documentation"" a few days ago and that I should be expecting a summons soon. I called the county clerk and had her look up any open cases for this and she said there is NOTHING under his name or mine!    I did not respond to his message but I was curious why there is no case number?   And if there is, and its just not uploaded on the database quite yet... Do I need to hire a lawyer right away? How will this even work?? He lives in Florida and I live in Missouri? Can a judge tell me I need to drive a 1,000 miles every month for visitation? I am a full time college student trying to finish my degree so I can support my daughter more... I dont see how its feasable? What is likely going to happen?  For the record: My husband covers both mine and my daughter's healthcare/housing/all expenses/food/etc from his income. We get nothing from her bio-dad whatsoever. She is in pre-school full time and has been with the same teaching staff since she was 10 weeks old. She is very adjusted and acclimated to her school. Will these things be factored in?",legaladvice

fra72,fra72,Kap001,So we have been seeing each other off and on for almost 2 years now.  Reasons for off and on being both of us going through not ready to commit kinda phases(I'm only 19 turning 20 soon).  The way I feel for her is completely different than anyone else I've seen so far.  The way I felt for her is what scared me the most as I'm pretty sure I am gonna be with her for a long time hence the scared to fully commit.  But currently we have been fighting(Or arguing not really full out yelling and such just sort of me getting heated.  She also has been having a lot of family issues).  Though I realized that most of the rough spots happen while we are texting.  We have spent about 2 weeks together on vacation over the summer with no problems what so ever.  I decided to text a lot less as we have been texting practically everyday for 3 years.  Does the texting less(At least during this rough spot) sound like a good idea?,relationshipadvice
c19sqwe,ejx1q,r00x,"Oh man, this is a tricky one.  I'm not married; never have been, but I've been living with my current girlfriend for the last three years and I know exactly how you feel. It was pretty much the same deal for me.  Doesn't it frustrate you in that you feel distracted from your work, like you feel obliged to spend time with her because you can't comprehend how she can just be sitting there casually browsing the net/watching TV all bloody day?!  If I wanted to get anything done I had to lock myself away. I designated a room as my 'Man-Cave', and asked gently if she mind leaving me be while I am inside it and the door is closed.  That was a reasonably effective stop-gap, but the only thing that resolved it in the end was her landing a job and being out of the house 08:30-18:00 every weekday. Other than that I just had to put up with the fact that having a hobby was a concept utterly lost upon her and so she'd just float about the house while I was trying to get things done. In fact she'd always misunderstand my suggestions that she get a hobby as a criticism for her not seeming to have something to occupy herself with mentally. That wasn't the case, and each time I'd have to explain at length about how I simply felt bad because I knew if I were her, I'd be slowly going mad from boredom, and that would in turn drive me up the wall whenever we were both in.   Ninja edit: A friend had a similar situation and made the exact same complaints, but hadn't a room to make a Man-Cave from.

She said she'd stop by my work today, and I agreed without looking up, or really registering what she'd said. She had been talking to me for a while, and I remember other parts of the conversation, but not that most important piece. Today when she called saying she was on her way over, I asked what for, and she quite rightly got upset that I didn't remember.  The extreme solution would be to drop everything I'm doing whenever she speaks to me, so that I never miss anything that she asks me to do, but that seems horribly impractical. (Maybe it's not?)

c13i1hs,dvs5t,kiyonisis,"Really? Talk about killing the mood. This is almost as bad as saying ""Is it OK if I kiss you/put my arm around you/etc"". Having to verbalize those things reeks of lack of confidence.   OP: This is where you need to start developing the crucial skills of reading body language, and more importantly, her reactions. These things are difficult to pick up and are more of an art form than a science. It is something that will grow on you with age and experience, and like learning any skill you must resign to the possibility/certainty that you will screw up eventually.  Here's an **example** scenario (aka do not try to recreate point by point)  You're sitting on the couch, cuddling. Your arm is around her - good job - and hopefully she is into it. How do you tell? Is she leaning into you, touching you, laying her head on your chest? These are all very good signs. Bad signs: She sits there like a limp fish, doesn't lean into you, and in general appears ""cold"". Note that every girl is different, sometimes very different. Some girls/cultures are naturally much more physically reserved, while other girls can be EXTREMELY touchy and mean nothing by it. A decent rule of thumb is to gauge if she acts positively or negatively to your advances, and how much.  If she isn't reacting favorably, it means one of two things: She isn't into it, or you are so passive she doesn't even recognize you are making a move. Use your judgement to decide which. If you think she isn't into it, that's a good time to back off so you don't get labeled as pushy/creepy.  Ok, so it's your lucky day and she's into you. You pull her in closer, wrap your arm all the way around her waist, and put your hand conveniently close/on hers. Lo and behold, she starts playing with your hand, and eventually you are holding hands (fingers interlocked style). She's still giving you positive signs, so you start roaming a bit with your hands. Not groping, but exploring her arms, back, stomach lightly and casually. She starts doing the same to you. Maybe you start playing with her hair and she's still sending out good vibes.  Now, at some point you have to make the leap of faith to actually try to kiss her. No matter how smooth you are, it's always a bit of a jump (which is what makes it exciting), but the key is not making it too much of a jump from what you're doing. An example of a bad leap of faith would be you're sitting on the couch doing nothing, and then try to plant one on her. If things are going well like they are in our story, you're already fooling around and being very touchy, so a much smoother move would be to pull her into you, face to face. This is where the classic gaze in to each other's eyes comes into play (but remember, it's a *gaze* not a stare). You look at her eyes, her lips, she does the same thing, then you start moving towards her, and hopefully she follows your lead. And they lived happily ever after.  **End Story**  TL;DR read her body language. Escalate slowly and smoothly through less ""committing"" actions such as cuddling, massaging, etc so that by the time to kiss her rolls around, you're already 90% there.",relationshipadvice

c1t2ckf,h6ztw,Professor_Lurker,"I agree with ds2k7.  Especially due to the giant leaps in technology we are facing today, many people just don't know how to express themselves in person.  However, this is not the biggest issue here.   You two don't seem to be communicating and thinking forwardly. This is a common issue in many relationships of all ages and can lead to ultimatums and uncomfortable situations.  When she gets upset, ask her exactly why she is upset.  The name calling and mudslinging get you nowhere and you need to both acknowledge this.    If it gets to the point where she isn't willing to have a real conversation with you (no matter what the medium: facebook, text, face-to-face, whatever), then she isn't putting the energy into the relationship that you are.    You also have some responsibility in this.  If it bothers you more to not be able to speak to her in person about the issues you are having in your relationship, you need to tell her and explain it to her. You'll need to be gentle about it, so I wouldn't recommend saying ""You're pissing me off because we never talk about this shit face to face."" I think it would be best to choose a quiet moment when you are not fighting and simply say something along the lines of, ""Hey babe, can we talk? I know we've been fighting a lot lately, and I wanted to ask you why you prefer to get through it via facebook/text? Personally, I feel it's a little disrespectful because I can not tell if you're being genuine, and it encourages you to be unnecessarily insulting.""   Last but not least, don't close your mind off to the idea that this may not work out.  I know it's a heart-wrenching thought, but it can actually help your relationship immensely to be open to the idea that it may, for whatever reason, not work out.  It sounds like you are young, and probably don't have the self confidence to realize that if it doesn't work out, it isn't entirely your fault. However, you shouldn't forget that this self confidence, from being your own person and not just ""relenting"" to your girlfriend who refuses to talk to you, also makes you more attractive and creates balance in the energy you devote to your girlfriend and she devotes to you.   tl;dr: Every Relationship Takes Work.

1tdlgj,1tdlgj,realprawbz,"So basically I'm in a bind.  A little backstory - I introduced my bf to smoking and we both did it for a couple of months together for fun. He had only done it a handful of times before. However, I haven't smoked once within the last eight months due to school, work, and just finding out it wasn't my thing.   My boyfriend has continued to smoke, and slowly it has increased. However, today was way too much for even me. I invited him over for dinner, and he drove over higher than a kite. I'm so against driving under the influence of anything, it really scared me he would do it.   I did tell him I wasn't okay with it. He insisted he wasn't high but confessed to it after a few minutes. He said he wouldn't do it anymore. Keyword was anymore, so this wasn't a first time offense.   I really don't mind the occasional smoke, it's like having a drink. But everyday for hours on end and then driving? I'm really worried and I don't want him to get a DUI, but I can't and won't be a helicopter girlfriend.  I love him so much, but am worried his pot use is affecting his life very negatively. I also feel guilty because I introduced it. How should I bring this up to him without totally sounding like a controlling beezy???",relationshipadvice
e0ls25b,8qqeh5,runthrowawaygirl,"That is one thing that I am worried about — I don’t know if I would personally be okay with my parents getting in enormous legal trouble. Part of me is hoping that once I leave, they’ll finally realize that how they’ve been treating me all my life has made me miserable and they’ll finally let go. But reality tells me that they’ll most likely freak out and do whatever it takes to get me back home with them.    So far the evidence I have are call logs/texts that could show telephonic harassment, some photographic evidence of physical abuse, and other evidence to show that I have been trying to find a job here at home and my parents not agreeing to any of them.   Sorry but I’m not sure I quite understand your last point. Are you saying that it’s better for their own legal status if they don’t do anything that would cause me to involve the police?

I've thought the same thing about my EX that broke up with me in Nov of 2010, 4 years is hard to erase, but at the same time I believe it is better for her, and myself if I do not try and contact her. I found out the best thing to help get over her was completely remove her from my life, of course I still think about her (like you do yours), but I don't ever plan to make contact.. Although I really did love her and miss her a lot, but at the same time life moves on. Not sure how much that helped, but  I am/was kinda in the same boat you are.

e8h67dl,9rhpin,Eeech,"There is a federal law called Family Educational Rights and Privact Act [FERPA] that all states must abide by at minimim; a few states have laws that expand the rights of students. I am unaware of any expansion law in Oregon, but it does not matter here.   There is no chance the school is able to legally identify the student and tell you what disciplinary actions will be taken specifically. I find it extremely unlikely they could name the author, but I am certain they can not disclose what they decide to do if they did; disclosing this information is explicitly forbidden under FERPA.   I fully understand your alarm and concern, but the fact your daughter is not the certain target of the letter limits the school even further with what they are permitted to share with you. They can *probably* tell you that they have identified and disciplined ""a student,"" but I would not even expect that. Schools must take FERPA rules seriously; they are not suggestions or goals, but absolutes.   You may ask how they plan to secure your daughters safety without betraying the confidentiality of the other student. You can complain to the superintendent or the school board if the principal has not taken steps you feel are appropriate in response. But again, bear in mind your ideal of being told who it was and what the school is doing is not legal for them to tell you. They are not pulling out a ""confidentiality"" flag to hide behind; the law really does prohibit that. Not being informed does not necessarily mean no action was taken.",legaladvice

5qrhcs,5qrhcs,anontechguy17,"Hi r/legaladvice!   I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I have been estranged/distanced from my father for about 10 years. We live in different states, me in Texas and him in Ohio. We haven't seen each other, and we only spoke about once every few months.   I was notified Thursday (2 days ago) of my fathers passing. I was told of his passing by a ""friend"". Come to find out, I strongly believe this friend may have been taking advantage of my father. This friend's wife was acting as caretaker for my father. He had very bad health and could not walk or take care of himself. The friend was the one who drove my father to the hospital on Thursday and then called me to tell me my father was dead. During that initial conversation, the friend said that there were many items in my fathers house that were sentimental to him and his wife *red flag #1*. He also mentioned that the property was in disrepair, and that there was a lot of debt that would need to be addressed *red flag #2*.   Since this friend was close enough to my father to be the one to drive him to the hospital, and he obviously had been to the house many times, I asked him to go back to the house and search for a Will or any documentation we could get to a Probate lawyer.   The next day the friend informed me that he couldn't locate anything. By this time, I had gotten in touch with my aunt - my father's sister. She lives ~2 hrs away. She was able to get today off of work to go to his house.   She said that when she got to the house today that pictures were off the walls, that there were obvious signs of furniture missing/moved - (spots left on the carpet as if something heavy had been taken.) I had her call my dad's friend and he returned with some paintings and told my aunt I told him it was okay for him to take things. (I did not! I told him we would talk with a probate lawyer, and if the law said it was okay - then we could look at letting him have any of the sentimental items.)  As my aunt looked through the house, she was not able to locate any further documentation (it's all missing) and a few other things came up. 1. My father was an AVID photographer as it was a hobby he could do even with his disability. I know he had multiple expensive digital cameras, my aunt said that no cameras were found anywhere. 2. My father used to be an avid hunter. The gun safe was empty and there was just some left over ammo in the drawer. At this point, I had my aunt call the local police to get a report filed that we believed there was a robbery.   Lastly - my aunt was able to turn on the computer and log into it. My profession is in computers, so I did a remote control session and began some forensic work to see if there way any valuable documents we could glean from the machine. Unfortunately, the logs all show that programs had been uninstalled earlier in the week, and all traces of activity had been deleted. I was able to open his email profile and recover a few very concerning items. One item was that the ""friend"" had sent an email to Amazon to tell them that my father had passed, and the friend gave Amazon all my info as ""next of kin"". I was also able to recover MANY emails that showed order statuses for Amazon, Cabelas, Sears and other locations. It appeared that earlier in the week (Mon/Tues) that my father had ordered thousands of dollars of sporting equipment (fishing supplies, a laser sight, etc...) this is VERY concerning as I know there is no way possible my father was going to be doing any sort of sporting... We reported this to the police officers, and they wanted to have us print everything we could.   Anyway - by this time, my aunt had been able to get a locksmith to change the locks on the house, and it was getting late in the day for her. So she had to leave. She was able to make a stop at the post office for a change of address so that any mail should come to me. ** Another note - my dad's friend had requested we NOT change the mailing address... yeah, right... after what we saw and found, like we wouldn't**  Anyhow - what should I do next?   My dad's body is still in the hospital morgue, and I'm hesitant to have the cremation service pick him up. What if these people were intending to scam my father and had somehow sabotaged his health?   Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.   **edit to include states/locations in body.",legaladvice

h5z09,h5z09,yellowuke,"Hello Redditors. I apologize in advance for the long story, and the confusion between the two girls I'm talking about. Just for your reference, I'm referring to one as ""my friend"" and one as ""the girlfriend."" I put a TL;DR at the end, but you'll get a better sense of it if you read the whole thing.  I'm incredibly worried about a bisexual friend (18 years old) I have right now. She's neurotic (the actual [mental disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis)), which means she overreacts and stresses about EVERYTHING.   She dated this one girl (18 years old) in high school for four years, and was constantly paranoid about the girl leaving her, etc. She would ask her girlfriend to come over at odd times in the night just to see if she was willing to come, and when she actually did, my friend would refuse to go down and see her, citing excuses like ""I'm too lazy to get dressed"" or ""I'm too tired."" The whole relationship was not great, since both sets of parents were against a lesbian relationship, so they had to do everything in secret. The girlfriend was pretty apathetic, and was always the passive one in the relationship. Thus, my friend constantly worried about how much her girlfriend actually loved her (partly due to her neurosis, partly due to her girlfriend's passivity). Her stress began increasing throughout high school and topped in the middle of our freshman year at college during winter break, when my friend finally broke up with her girlfriend. It was not a great breakup, and she cut off all contact with the girlfriend. Initially she cried all the time and was constantly stressed and anxious because of this breakup. She flipflopped between being happy at being single, wanting another guy desperately, and wanting to get back together with her ex.   Second semester of college, only a couple weeks after she broke up with her girlfriend, my friend began dating a guy (19 years old). He was the complete opposite of her ex, and was incredibly loving, caring, and clingy. My friend loved it at first, but then started to get annoyed with it. She realized that the two people she dated were at both extremes of the clingy vs. passive spectrum. She's suffered lots of anxiety periods due to her fear that no one will love her, and has begun to start talking to and being close with her ex-boyfriend again, to the point where most people don't even know they ever broke up.   A while ago she unblocked her ex-girlfriend on her AIM account. Just today, she saw that her ex was online, using the account that only my friend knew about. She then proceeded to freak out, etc., wondering if she should block her again, or wait for her to IM, or take the initiative to IM her.   In a normal situation, I would advise her to talk to her ex-girlfriend, since that would normally bring peace of mind. But since she is so distressed at times, I don't know if bringing back the connection will be better for her. There's also the very strong probability that she'll want to get back together with her ex. The thing is, she will suffer from anxiety no matter what. I just don't know which choice will be better than the other.  **TL;DR:** 4 months ago, my friend, afflicted with [neurosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis), ended a 4-year lesbian relationship (but she still loved her). A couple weeks later, she got into a very intense relationship with a guy and recently broke up with him, but still stays pretty emotionally intimate with him. Recently, she unblocked her ex-girlfriend and saw her online, and has been stressing over whether or not to talk to her. She's asking my advice, and I want to try to advise her on which choice will be better for her, with her neurosis in mind.",relationshipadvice

A lot of things she does seem pretty flirty, but I was hoping others could weigh in. She often tells me she hates me or that I suck with a smiley face when I'm teasing her. Also she has offered me a sip of her drinks on a few occasions, and she's taken sips of my drinks when I've offered to her.   We text every few days and it seems she's just looking for excuses to start conversations sometimes. The thing that makes me wonder though is how she'll often text me first, sometimes with a question, and then take 10-40 minutes to respond to my reply. I'll reply and the wait starts over again. She often talks about how bored she is too, so I don't think she's always busy, especially late at night. Our conversations may span 6 or more hours, but only have 15 exchanges or so. If she were interested would she take so long to respond every time? Why does she take so long to reply even after starting the conversation? Another thing is sometimes I won't reply for a while and she'll send another message about something else, so I don't think she's trying to stop talking to me.",relationshipadvice

Basically, I made a Facebook post blasting a former high school teacher at the school where I was a student (over ten years ago) for being inappropriate with female students. I did not use his name as I didn't want it to be screen capped and sent to him (we have many mutual student friends), and I don't want to deal with any sort of retaliation.   When people asked ""who"" I said I would be happy to message them directly but was wary to have it on my page.  One of my friends wrote his name in a couple of comments.

I began to like her a lot and eventually we admitted to both liking each other and one thing led to another and we both said the I love you's later on.   In our relationship, there have been two breaks in it, once when she got kissed by this guy, and the second when she started to think it would never work out with us. However, both times we fell back into our old habits.   During the second time we split, I tried to change her mind and convince her we could work, but she wouldn't have any of it. But then, when she told me she changed her mind and liked me, I was already feeling a little distant because of all of this and she used the same things I had told her to try and convince her to keep trying with us.   So here we are now, a month after all this, and we are pretty much the same as when we were a thing. I really do like her a lot, but I feel more and more that it might not work, and now there is this girl who seems interested, but I don't know what to do now. This girl would probably not turn into a serious relationship, but nonetheless, she lives here and not away from me.   What do you guys think I should do? She wants to go here for college and she may move back to a city an hour or so away from me next year, so there is a sliver of hope for us, but I'm uncertain of what the future will hold for us.

1a0sha,1a0sha,,"I'm a (39/f) travelling with my girlfriend who is also a (39/f).  We have been friends since the 9th grade...  so over 20 years.  My girlfriend is often a very fun, gregarious, and lively character.  Unfortunately she has had little success with finding true love and has had few successful long term relationships.  She is a single mother and has done a very good job parenting her 13 year old.  However, she also suffers from body dysmorphia syndrome and is consumed with her appearance.  This becomes tedious at times, as I find that most of my conversations with her revolve around reassuring her that she looks okay, that an outfit is flattering, that she isn't to heavy.... you get the point.  She is also OVERLY consumed with gauging how she stacks up when comparing herself to other women.  She can be exceedingly negative and critical of complete strangers.  In a nutshell, she's that person who really doesn't like their self, and so it is a constant critique of everyone else around her AT ALL times.  She also has never really traveled. I, on the other hand, have traveled extensively both in and out of the country.   Trying to reach an agreement on where to go and what hotel to stay in was exhausting. It took months.  Each time I suggested a hotel, even offering to pay up front for the two of us, she had to look for what she considered a better choice.  She later got angry with me when I opted for a rental car instead of a hotel shuttle.  I did it because I couldn't afford to waste a week negotiating with her. It was cheaper than a shuttle, and afforded us greater freedom.  She's thinking that Mexico (Cancun) is a third world country and that we'll be targeted.  I don't hold this against her, and I understand her fear.  But I'm a confident traveler who would never put us into a situation that jeopardizes are safety.  Simply put, her inability to make decisions is a chronic affliction.  She is unable to make decisions for fear of making the wrong one.  She literally acknowledged to me last week that she often has to call her mother at the grocery store when trying to decide what detergent to purchase.  I love her - but I I think she would be better served spending this vacation $$$ on a good therapist.  I want to help her and perhaps I should try to have an honest dialogue with her on this vacation is the way to go.  Maybe not.   I'm friends with someone who is radically different and there is a lot to be said for what I do gain from maintaining this friendship - but I need advice as to how I can make this a wonderful trip for her while maintaining my own sanity.  I just tell myself to grin and bear it.  Bite your tongue and let it all roll off my back - but I know this will be a challenge.  In the past, when I have disagreed with her, she thinks I am ""arguing"" with her.  I informed her that disagreeing with someone is not ARGUING with them and that she needs to understand the difference.  But I don't think that she does.  I really want to enjoy this vacation too but I really fear that this might be something I am going to regret.",relationshipadvice

dzdz8mf,8l7jxp,Daleth2,"So he took your car without permission? Did you know he had taken it (I mean before the accident)?  Your insurance will generally cover an accident caused by an unlicensed, uninsured car thief, but obviously not an accident caused when you let an unlicensed driver take your car out for a spin. And they probably also wouldn't cover a family member who took your car without permission, especially if you didn't call the cops to report that he had stolen it. If they covered family members in that situation then people could just let their unlicensed relatives drive and claim later, if there was an accident, that they hadn't given permission.   So this is a situation where you're on the hook for the damage caused to the other car, and if you want to recover any of that money, your brother is the person you'll have to go after. And since he's a minor, your parents (or whichever one has custody of him) would be who you'd have to go after, if your brother isn't willing or able to pay you back what he cost you.

My boyfriend is a really wonderful guy, but he has a lot of issues... when we first started going out, everything was great. The only thing I noticed is that he was really affectionate but that's not really a problem. Then the mood swings started. He goes through periods where everything just overwhelms him and he gets depressed and thinks about suicide. Through all of this, he is incredibly sweet to me and everything, but it has become apparent that he is entirely dependent on me for emotional support. It's really hard for him to talk about this and doesn't really have other close friends... we both have a lot of trouble connecting with other kids our age, but he does especially. There is a history of mental health problems in his family. Normally everything is great, but when he gets depressed it is really starting to scare me, especially since he has suicidal thoughts. I am just beginning to freak out realizing what I am getting myself into, and even though I love him, thoughts of breaking up with him are starting to run through my head... I feel like this is not healthy. However he is a great guy and boyfriend, and we are perfect for each other. I don't want to lose him.

2o7jlm,2o7jlm,Tanjobi,"Got hit walking in a crosswalk by an uninsured motorist.  Not my fault.  My auto insurance company policy has uninsured coverage well over whats required.  They're trying to get me to accept a lump sum, and then their subrogation unit takes over.  I have to get a $5K dental crown procedure every 10-15 years (a range they gave me) for the rest of my life: i.e. 4-2.66 procedures=3.33avg procedures.    They say I can legally have one procedure paid for under my PIP coverage with them. Rep offers me the price of 1 procedure over that for my 'suffering'.  Been told multiple times that I should be getting about $5K over the procedure cost for suffering.  His reason why he offered that is I should just get dental insurance and pay with that and foot the copay.  Is this bullshit or standard? Should I ask him to show me something like a LexisNexis analysis? Anyone had experience using LexisNexis?  Can I ask for future dental supplies or whatever to make them last longer?",legaladvice

6jv0u1,6jv0u1,moonpeek,"My partner works full time and has health insurance through their employer.  While going to college, student loans were taken out. The school is configured to take out loans in their name for all fees required for schooling. This included fees for health insurance in the sum of ~$3000.  My partner was sent emails about how to opt out of this service, but they were not read, primarily because they were sent to a school email. After graduation the fees were challenged via the school. School said the service was already paid for and rendered, no reversal would occur. Furthermore they claim my partner was clearly warned about how to opt out of the service.  I find it troublesome that one would be automatically opted in for a service that is not necessarily needed. I am wondering if this has something to do with requiring everyone  to have health insurance? Even so, why automatically sign up everyone for health insurance from a specific provider the school chooses?  To me it feels like a racket.

My insurance company is saying they are calling it a no fault since me and the other guy are telling two different stories.

I was thinking of the event, yes I collided with him, but he also collided with me.  That's how impacts work.  The insurance company wants me to go to court and claim no fault since it's basically one word against the other.  At that point the charges would likely be dropped.  Then they say if I just get the ticket adjusted to a non-moving violation it's an admission of guilt and then they would have to do arbitration.  My attorney says to just pay him and court costs and I get to forget about everything.  The charges would be dropped down to a non-moving violation, no points, life goes on.

74nnnt,74nnnt,StupidwithCredit,"I was stupid with a credit card years ago and ran into financial hardship and ignored the issue, yesterday I received a summons I need to answer within 28 days on the lawsuit of 2800 dollars plus court fees. The summons does not have a court date.   I currently make around 500 a week and do not have a house,car, or apartment in my name. After all my current bills I say I have about 750 in spending cash each month.   Towards the end of the month I am expecting to receive an inheritance of $40,000 from a family estate which has been going through the steps in probate court for about a year, the estate lawyer expects to send checks in just a couple of weeks but it has been pushed back a couple times previously. He does not foresee that happening again though.  My questions, and I appreciate any advice I can receive!   Can I still settle with the plaintiff’s lawyer outside of court? What would be an appropriate counter offer with what I owe and my current earnings? Do I need a lawyer for this? Is this something I do in person, email, or by mail to ask for a settlement? Do I have to be careful how I write an offer?  The summons asks for an answer on the complaint within 28 days, I don’t really understand what I say as an answer, just that I agree or disagree with the complaint?   If I was to go to court and deemed at fault (I am, I know I made a very bad decision to ignore it for so long). Do they expect payment immediately? If I don’t have the available funds can I be jailed? How much can they garnish my wages and how long?   Should I inform about the incoming inheritance?   My plan currently is see if I receive my inheritance in a couple of weeks like is expected, then respond to the plaintiffs lawyer with a counter offer lump sum of 2500.   If I do not receive it in time is a payment plan outside of court possible?  Sorry for all the jumbled questions, I really regret my decision of ignoring it but know I need to face what is coming and settle my debts. It will be good to get this all over with.

6r7b9x,6r7b9x,OnGamesStudio,"My girlfriend and I just recently had our apartment broken into and had several thousand dollars worth of items stolen/damaged. No one was hurt as both of us were at work and we have renters insurance so it's not a huge financial hit to us.   The problem is with the building management being what appears to us as negligent about security issues. After talking to other tenants, burglaries have been a problem in the building since January and nothing about security seemed to change after that. We were never informed about these problems when we signed a lease in May. There are two doors with codes and fab access. The back door to the parking lot doesn't always close completely and needs to be pulled shut by whoever uses it (defeats the purpose of a secure door). I never emailed about this but it's possible that someone else in the building did. The codes on these doors also are always the same. The elevator has a code to access your floor but this code works for every floor and there are always the stairs. Management says there are security cameras but I don't see any.  Management also isn't exactly quick if at all to respond via email on these security topics. The incident happened Monday and we aren't getting a new lock until Thursday morning (2 days, 16 hours later). Called the emergency maintenance # to get a new lock the day of the burglary and no one answered or called back. We had to email again after the first time to get a response the next day.

5vh4k5,5vh4k5,IdiotTraveler,"EDIT: After doing more research and thinking on the issue, I have fully realized that yes, this was entirely a scam. Other people's stories are so similar to mine and it really is an insanely elaborate and intense operation. From an outside perspective I can see how anyone would consider someone who falls for this to be a complete idiot, however, the tactics and methods they used are extremely ruthless and effective. Personally, my motivation was not even rooted in greed, but in a desire to travel with the guys and see parts of India I would never have the opportunity to. Without being in the situation it is impossible to explain just how strongly a person can have complete control of you, your emotions, and your actions. If anyone is interested in the full story(it is insane how elaborate the scheme actually is), let me know! In any case thanks for the responses, they finally made me face the reality I did not want to believe and now I can do my best to start reconstructing my life.   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ok, so I fucked up and made quite a big mistake. I had been traveling around the world while finishing up school and when I was India I ran into the wrong people and in my naive and too open minded state, made a completely terrible decision. I won’t go into the full details of how or why I ended up going along with the guys, as it really does not matter and I have already accepted that if even if I was mislead, lied to, taken advantage of, and even threatened, I still made the initial choice that made me committed. Basically what happened is this, I agreed to assist in a “loophole” in which a person with a tourist visa “purchases”(does not actually pay the company anything) jewelry at its India value, sends it home to another country(in this case US)  through mail in which India customs clears it, and then picks up it after returning home. After receiving the package in the home country the person would then return it to the company branch in that area and the company would then be able to sell the items cleanly without paying the taxes and fees they normally would, while I would receive a commission on the value of the jewelry in India. As for the company, the person I was working with was one of the owners of a quite large family run jewelry and precious stone business that has been in operation for more than 100 years and does business worldwide. For 95% of my time in India the only two people that I had contact with where two people from the company whom I will call  Chris and James, Chris was an employee for the company who was traveling for a few weeks and James was one of the owners of the company.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So very quick summary of the events of the week this transpired(I can provide more detail if it is helpful): I agree with to help them, within 3 hours we packaged the jewelry, filled out the paperwork(of which I was dictated what to write), I dropped the parcel off at the post office and James took the paperwork to customs. For the remainder of the time I was with Chris 24/7 and even at one point was told to turn off all my electronics so I only had contact with the two of them. The next day when we were supposed to get the customs declaration, the customs office calls me instead and asks basic questions before stating their suspicions about the situation since we did not provide proof of any transaction. They state that they know where I am, not to try anything, and the quicker I can provide proof will dictate their response to this potentially very big problem. James sends the company lawyer and manager to the office to figure out what is wrong and to try to get it fixed with Baksheesh(bribes). Turns out that customs was in high alert due to an individual who was recently arrested in Thailand for doing the same thing with two companies at the same time(which I came to learn that this company was one of the two) Later that evening, as what I saw was my only option, I made transactions with the company for everything I have, $21k(which I had saved to use to travel the world for the rest of the year). Next day James arrives and says that customs wanted to see at least 50% of the transaction, which I could not provide. He sends his lawyer with cash to try show more of the purchase while he books the next flight back to the US for me(he has to pay baksheesh to the border control at the airport, talking with them individually, to let me through on my flight since my passport had a hold on it)(while I still had a chance at leaving India and not being arrested if things went poorly). That evening they take me directly to the airport to make sure nothing goes wrong and I board a flight back home. I talk to him a few more times on the phone over the last week and half since I came back and from what I was told the situation is as follows: customs declined the cash transaction and gave us 7 days to demonstrate more transactions otherwise they would not remove the smuggling charges they currently had against us(I do not know the extent or what exactly the charges are as all I know is from a brief statement James made in a phone call), I make it clear that I can no longer do anything on my end and want out, he also runs out of options, and the last time I spoke to him he was going into hiding(turning off his phones in the process) while his lawyers try and fix the situation. &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Alright, so I have already fully accepted the consequences of my mistake and that I most likely lost all of my money and will have to completely start over, however, I do not know much about India law/international law and just wanted to see if anyone has any advice when it comes to a few points: &amp;nbsp;    * -Is there any chance of trying to fight the situation legally to try and get the charges removed/get my money back?  * -Will this affect me on traveling in the future or just if I tried to go back to India? I am supposed to study abroad in Korea in August and am worried that depending on what charges/if there are actual charges against me in India that I might be denied a student visa?  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I know that agreeing to go along with them was probably the biggest mistake I will ever make in my life and to me it’s not the money that I care about, but the year of experiences that I blindly tossed away. I won’t try to explain/excuse my motivation and thought process as I understand that no matter the circumstance I still made the choice and am responsible for the result. All I am trying to do from this point is begin to rebuild the life I destroyed and want as much information/advice as possible when it comes to the legal situation involved.",legaladvice

It took a while, but I finally got hold of the local food safety person. She informed me that there are no requirements at all about food labeling, such as the expiration dates I mentioned. The second issue I was criticized for (temps) is also not a violation of their policies. She did not consider them to be a significant problem. Some things gave her pause, but nothing jumped out.  I was also given clarification that, (not in their words), there are bigger fish to fry. Restaurants holding pizza slices at room temperature for a day or two before serving it, for example. Or handling raw meat and fresh vegetables.  So there are other issues, but the rules I got in trouble for *not* breaking are apparently not a big deal *legally speaking* here. Which means our corporate rules are more strict than local legal regulations. I have decided to go along with my manager's requests, with certain reservations and limits. I will never do something that I categorically believe will put public safety at risk.  And honestly, what made me the *most* angry was probably when I was told to obey ""without hesitation"" whenever told to break rules. To be spoken down to, as though I'm an upstart who needs to learn his place, and I should know better than to think I can question my manager for something so trite as food safety. And for those who asked, I think corporate would side with me, but none of my managers would. Just one of those things...  I'm currently looking for another job.",legaladvice

We lost our virginities to each other, and she's the only girl I've lasted with in such a long relationship. She really meant a lot to me.  This past December, she broke up with me because she felt like she wasn't getting the appropriate attention, and apparently she didn't want to feel guilty if she did something with someone else. Before she broke up, she said that she really wanted to be with me in the long term, but I said I wouldn't guarantee anything if she broke up with me. She did so after quite some time trying to convince me otherwise.  She then had a relationship for 2 months with someone else who had apparently been pressuring her to break up with me for quite some time while we were together.  Recently they broke up, and now she wants to be back with me. They had sex, and that drives me nuts (I basically want to beat the shit out of the guy). I also feel betrayed, deceived, hurt, unwanted, and like a second choice.

ijwm7,ijwm7,,"I've been working at an office for most of the year as a temp.  I was dating someone when I started.  The girl I was seeing burned me badly. I turned to some of my female coworkers for advice, and one in particular was very helpful to me.  She called me out of the blue and talked to me for hours, she actually took me out for drinks too.  Really there for me.  She's in her late 30s, divorced.  I'm almost 27.  She was single...or so I thought.  I find her fairly attractive.  Her personality is a lot of fun.  I tried to get to know her better, and she would agree to hang out, but usually cop out at the last minute and cancel.    Recently, I called her.  She called back two hours later and it turned out she was in a massive breakup fight with her lesbian lover.  Turns out, she's bisexual and had been keeping it secret.  I run over there because her partner was getting violent and try keep things civil.  After we kicked out the nutcase (she punched me several times in the process), my coworker and I hung out and had very nice time.  We hugged and kissed each other on the cheek goodbye, although her kiss was way more neck than cheek.  Definitely got me excited as I walked out.  Later that week, she told me she owed me infinitely.  I asked her to drinks, she accepted.  We went out and had a fantastic time.  Got pretty hammered.  She made references to wanting to date men again, and that her mom was excited that she was going out with a guy but that 26 is waaaay too young for her.  I blew it off since she was already out with me.  Lots of light and casual touching.  When we walked back, she revealed that her mom, who was in town, was actually still at her place, and that next time we went out, it'd be much later than midnight.  She set herself up to dodge a potential kiss, which I wasn't going for anyway since she had just broken up with someone.  She texts me three days later to say she had a great time and that we could go out whenever I wanted and that she was always available.  Later that week, I chose Saturday again.  We went out again.  This time, she was much more guarded, drank much less, and I walked her home earlier than last time, although she and I were giving a lot of physical contact.  I get to work that Tuesday, and she was clearly ignoring me.  She then texts me at work to ask if *I'm* the one who's grouchy, I tell her no.  The rest of the week, she has since avoided talking to me except when she's had to, to the point of sitting literally two chairs away from me to speak to one of the gay guys at work and not acknowledge me.  I guess I can say that I'm more confused than upset.  Her lesbian ex was rattling off about how I was the cause of the breakup and that she knew something was going on because my coworker talked about me all the time, and that she was enjoying the attention I had been giving her but would be manipulated by her.  Wow.  So, what is really going on here?  TL;DR My older attractive bisexual coworker is sending very mixed signals. What do?

We didn't date other people when we were apart aside from a few drunken flings, etc. and our break ups were always initiated by me and my problems regarding our inability to connect in the way I'd always wanted to with someone.

And, when I make jokes that belittle the music/tv/whatever, it makes her feel like I'm attacking her too.  Which, I totally get.  And honestly, the jokes I make about her interests are no more harsh than the jokes my friends and I make about the things we all like.  I'm assuming she takes it more personally because everyone mocks the things she likes, and she knows so little about those things that she can't even defend them.  One of my biggest issues is that she doesn't say that she loves me.  And, by that, I mean she will not say it first.  I've gone so far as to 'up my game' and make her breakfast in bed when we were in school, leave her little notes, take her on picnics, everything I could think of.

I'm not too sure how long we were going out for but I had strong feelings for her, she was the most beautiful, kind, caring girl I had ever met and I was her first proper girlfriend apparently.  We reached that stage that all couples reach apparently where they doubt the relationship and let all the bad thoughts come into their head and think the worst, I didn't realise but I had helped her through it.  I went away for a family trip for a week and about mid way through the week that stage hit me. As I do I jumped to the worst conclusions, felt terrible all the time and ended up cutting it off in a terrible rushed decision.   Now this leads onto two days ago. As over the past 5 months I have been reflecting and constantly feeling shitty as I took the worst way possible and broke up by text (I know i'm inexperienced as all hell don't hate please) and decided that screw it i'm gonna pm her a massive apology and asked to see if we could sort it all out.  She said yes, we had a good chat about it all and it just seemed awkward but we agreed to try and be mates at the end of it.  Her close mate messages me last night about it and I ended up finding out that my ex has forgiven me.... Also that she still has very strong feelings for me, she never messages me cause she was too scared too and thought I hated her (I had the same thoughts) and that if I want to try get back with her to make sure I'm 100%  Now heres the thing. I kinda do want go get back with her, I miss her, but there is also that part inside me that is saying ""no, you have college starting this year, she doesn't even go to your school, why stay with her when you can go out, get drunk carefree and have a good time practising with girls that don't matter in the morning"".

I don't know the best way to handle the situation and hoping it does not have to resolve by me moving.  I just found this sub so I apologize if I ramble. I'm not sure how much back-story is needed.   Five years ago my SO and I signed a lease for a single family home. It was a one year lease and it's been going on a month to month since.  Up until two months ago I have had minimal contact with the landlord.    In 5 years I may have seen him twice and talked to him on the phone only a few times.   Two months ago I contacted him to advise that my SO and I have separated and he is no longer living here and if there should be a process to remove him from the lease. I also explained how for the month of December full rent would be about 15 days late because I am now paying the full $1500 by myself and need a little time to cut expenses and wait for a paycheck to cover the full rent. I explained that for January everything would be back on schedule and I should not have anymore issues with paying on time. In 5 years there has never been a single late payment.   He was fine with this. But he also made some comments that I found odd.   He started bashing my ex whom he has only met once during the lease signing. Saying how he was stupid to leave such a lovely lady. Also, things like, ""someone so pretty should't be living alone. (I have my 2 teenagers living with me)  I just said, It's okay and we'll be fine and ended the conversation.   Then, I stared noticing weird shit. Because I was now paying everything myself I became super diligent with making sure all lights were off whenever we were not in the room or at home.  I would come home to the lights being on. Random things would be moved from where I knew I left them. A dog gate I have blocking the stairs so the dogs don't go downstairs was left open.   I suspected my ex and I gave him a call. We are still super cool (the relationship just ran it's course) but he said he has not been by.  Plus, he no longer has a key and there were no signs of forced entry.   This worried my ex and he helped me set up a make-shift security camera using an old laptop and some free program.  I also set up little boobie traps and I waited.  The laptop crapped out before it was able to catch anything but my boobie traps proved someone was in my house. Even opening my dresser drawer.   That's where I am now. The landlord is the only one with access to the home. Nothing has been noticed missing and I have no ""proof"".  I have no money to move and really not wanting to move with it being winter and uprooting the kids. I'm worried of him telling me to leave if I go about this in a way that might piss him off. I'm on a month to month and he can do this.  What should I be doing? Should I see about signing another lease to secure my home for another year before confronting him? Should I call the police?

I had never heard of B, and I find no positive, and many negative, reviews of them on Yelp.   My experience so far (well past the Dec. 29 delivery estimate on Company B's tracking page) has been eerily similar to the horror stories in the bad Yelp reviews: no shipment yet, tracking page stuck on ""in transit"", no update on it since Dec. 18, and chatting and emailing the customer support always ends in broken promises -- they say they'll find out info and get back to me, and they never do.  I don't expect to receive my shipment, at this point, and I'm wondering just what legal recourse a person has who finds themselves in my situation.

Typically states allow people to sue them for run-of-the-mill things like personal injury.  Even if the state improperly prevented him from investing, in order to sue the state, the state would have to have ok'd that kind of a lawsuit, which I doubt it ever has.  But, who knows.  * A statute of limitations sets a deadline for filing a lawsuit.  They typically run in 2-4/6/ years or so.  This is way beyond that time.  * Even if the statute of limitations is not a problem, many/most public entities require you follow a specific claims process before you are allowed to file a lawsuit.  Those processes can/often/usually have much shorter deadlines than the regular statute of limitations to file an initial claim.  If you miss the claim deadline, you cannot sue because you failed to follow the claims process first.  So, you'd have to see if MA has this process, and if it does he's certainly missed any applicable deadline.",legaladvice

17qu3y,17qu3y,,"I have trouble forgiving people. I always have, and until recently I really didn’t see it as a problem. I can put things away in my mind and try and forget it, but when I hear names or any specific words, all I can think of is the incident. It’s become a really big problem in my relationship, I love my boyfriend, but some things that he’s done in our relationship (mostly attributed to simply not being a sensitive enough guy) still riles me up, and when I hear certain things that reminds me of them, I get really upset and want to be alone and away from him.  Here’s a recent example, and also something that still really bothers me: We’re lazying around a living room with some friends, been drinking all night, but by no means belligerent drunk. He starts a conversation with a friend, but loud enough that everyone in the room can hear, including me. He says that he wishes he “read the signs better” with another girl, 2 years before we started dating. As insensitive as I think that is to say around your current girlfriend, it really struck a chord with me because he was talking about a girl that he had brought to a concert in our first year of dating. Although nothing happened between them, I bluntly told him I was not comfortable with this, and it upset me. He told me that he never had feelings for her, and never will. When I heard him telling his friend he regretted not “reading the signs better”, it hurt a LOT. I called him out on the spot and he told me I was overreacting, that everybody has stuff like that in the past, that he was a single guy at the time and everyone has regrets like that. It upsets me because I felt lied to. He apologized for hurting me, it makes me feel any better, but it still hurts when I think about it. I don’t want to still be hurt by this, but I don’t know how to forgive him for it.   My philosophy is that nobody ever really forgives anyone. They try and forget about it, and when enough time passes and that person stops becoming relevant in your life, you just stop caring about your grudge. In my relationship, everything that my boyfriend does that hurt me gets piled up, even if he didn’t mean to and has tried to make amends. I just don’t know how to forgive.    What do you think Reddit?",relationshipadvice

However, whenever I am about to ask out any girl (granted, it hasn't been that many), I never can get the balls to. I can manage to get a conversation started, but quickly become very self conscious, and avoid asking them.

I'm just not certain if she's just being friendly or not.  But, there's a huge problem (potentially). I dated her best friend for a few months last year. She broke up with me, but I've been over it for a long time.

gi64k,gi64k,throwaway1548,"I have an awesome girlfriend, but serious trust issues. Me and my girlfriend just talked and I need to make some changes ASAP but I have no clue where to even start.  I should probably give some background: In high school I had a girlfriend who seemed to be great, we will call her girl 1. Things were about as typical as you could get for a high school relationship. She ended up cheating on me and in my fit of high school angst I freaked out, we split, and I thought it was the end of the world. It wasn't.  I then went to college and things were ok, I was single, it was fun etc etc etc.   There was this girl, we will call her girl 2, who lived back home who I had known and had a huge crush on for probably 2 years. Cut to my junior year of college. Me and girl 2 were both at a mutual friends birthday party, we had some drinks, and ended up hooking up. She told me she was going to the same college the next semester and how it was great that we will be able to finally have something. This was true to an extent. Girl 2 came over all the time, we always had fun, and things seemed to point at a relationship. This was at least, until I found out girl 2 had a boyfriend who she decided to not tell me about and lie to him about me also. Again I eventually got over it, but it was hard. I decided to do the single thing again, and just have fun. I did and then met girl 3.   Girl 3 and I lived in the same apartment complex and hung out often. We decided to start a relationship and I said that things needed to go slowly. She agreed and I was pretty stoked she understood. We dated for a  year and half. I thought she was great and there was a possibility that it might be the last relationship for me. She liked my family, I liked hers, I liked her friends, She liked me. What could be better right? Well I graduated college, came home and found a job. She then calls me in June, two months after I move back home telling me she has cheated on me with a guy who was trying to pursue her at the same time I had. She had been lying to me and telling me her friend ""alli"" was coming over and they were going to hang out for a little when it was really him. Or that our mutual friend ""bryan"" was going to use her washing machine as he had a unit without him when that was a complete lie. I was obviously pretty devastated but I got over it ALOT more quickly than I expected.  I was completely over the situation and I meet girl 4.   She is literally everything I want in a girlfriend. I should add that I am 24 and she is 21. We get along amazingly, neither of us are big party-ers, and we can be ourselves around eachother. But I cannot shake the feeling that she is basically just going to cheat on me. Why not right? Everyone else seemed to not care, why should she? I have to change this. I cant continue thinking she is not faithful when I know she is. I just cant seem to let down my guard and it is hurting her, which I obviously don't want. I get jealous, and angry, and the feelings of how it felt to be cheated on come rushing back and I feel like its just going to happen all over again. She doesn't deserve this and I need to change.    Does anyone have experience in this area that could possibly give me some advice on where to even begin. I have been trying but it is not evident since what I need to work on is letting my guard down.   TL,DR: I am an idiot who thinks my faithful girlfriend is going to cheat on me and I cant shake the feeling.   Sorry for the wall of text.",relationshipadvice

kjxxq,kjxxq,throwaway73313,"So my girlfriend and I had been together for almost 3 and a half years, and were living together.  A few months ago, she cheated on me, and finally admitted it after it had been going on for several weeks.  During those weeks of cheating, she essentially did not come home at all, and I was not able to reach her, as she did not have a working cell phone at the time.  When she finally admitted it, I asked her if she wanted to be with him, and she said ""I don't know"".  I should have just dropped her at that point, but I was grasping at straws, and asked her about trying an open relationship where we can date other people.  I tried to cope with the situation, but it was eating me alive.  We already had limited amounts of time together due to opposite work schedules, but now she was spending large portions of what little time we did have together with him instead.  I'm aware that open relationships can work, but the nature of how things started between the two of them was always going to eat me alive.  After dealing with this for two months, and trying to get her to end things with him, I gave her an ultimatum, and told her she had to decide between the two of us:  she had to be to work in an hour, and I had come home from my job specifically to ask her to decide.  I told her that if she did not decide, that I would decide for us, and we would be done.  As the fellow that she had cheated with was a co-worker of hers who also lives nearby, they would always go to work together.  He came to the door to take her to work, and I asked her to choose before she left, and that if she did not, she should hug me goodbye, and it would be over.  She did not choose, and she left to go to work with him, saying ""We'll talk more later when I get home, I can't deal with this now, I have to go to work.""    That afternoon, I told my friends and family that she had cheated, and that I had tried to work through it, but that she had not been able to make a decision, and that it was over.  She came back home that night after work, with ""the other guy"", and I blew up, yelling and screaming at her, telling her how much she hurt me, that she needed to come get her shit, and that she was no longer welcome at my apartment without me being there.  I also yelled at the guy, so that he knew how badly he had fucked me up and had hurt me, even though I had tried to make things work with the three of us for the past two months.  She came over the next morning to get some clothes, as she had only the clothes on her back when she left the night before.  She wanted to know what would happen if she told him it was over, and I said ""It's too late.""  Before she left, I cried and told her I still loved her, but that she had missed her chance.  She called me the next day, and asked if we could talk more on Tuesday (her day off), as we hadn't had a chance to ""talk things out"".  Over the course of the next few days, I got a long email about how she hurt me, and she knew it, and all she wanted now was to be with me, but she didn't realize that right away, and that she needed a chance to explore her feelings for the other guy without her feelings for me getting in the way.  I didn't answer the email, but she has been calling me frequently wanting to know where I stand on this.  She is not in the best of shape financially, and has been living with ""the other guy"" for the past few days; she would have a lot of trouble finding a place to live on her own without someone to help support her.  I told her that she would need to figure out who she is, and that she would also need to end all contact with him, and find her own place to live; I also offered to have her live with me temporarily until she can find her own place to live, because obviously living with him would no longer be acceptable.  So, now that I've already given this girl far too many chances, I just need everyone on Reddit to tell me that I'm an idiot for even considering taking her back.  My friends and family will think I'm an even bigger chump than they already must for giving her as many chances as I have.  The problem is that I still love this girl even after everything she's done to me, and that I can't just turn that off after 3 and a half years together.  Thoughts?  TL;DR:  Girl cheated, couldn't choose between boyfriend of over 3 years and co-worker she knew for four months and cheated with.  I gave an ultimatum to choose, she couldn't decide, I threw her out, now she wants to come back.",relationshipadvice

d0zq9b9,4adpdg,PvtSherlockObvious,"I suspect that the discrepancy is because of the different definitions of ""arrest.""  Laypeople frequently have a mental image of arrest as handcuffs, the hood or back seat of a cop car, a jail cell, etc.  While those are examples of arrest, they aren't the only cases.  Strictly speaking, any time your travel and movement are being restricted, your freedom has been ""arrested"" and you are said to be ""under arrest.""  Under the legal definition, even a simple traffic stop is a form of arrest.  Failure to comply with a legal order under those circumstances is said to be resisting that state of arrest.  That's why they're considered to be the same thing:  If a cop is in a position to give you a lawful order, you're already under arrest going by the technical definition.  Under the lay definition, I get it seems perverse that simply being uncooperative is regarded the same way as breaking the cop's grip and making a run for it, but at its core, the difference is one of degree, not of kind.",legaladvice

Your landlord is allowing you to break the lease or pay a diminished enjoyment price. That's very cool. You can either live in that apartment *full well knowing what is going to happen* and therefor not expect him to pamper you or make the apartment new overnight, or you can break your lease and find a new place to live. Are you suggesting it's his fault you chose to live in a city you can't afford because he's the only place you could afford?

c2o6fqq,kxyse,nowxisxforever,"Hmmm.   Honestly, from the sounds of it, I'd stick with monogamy if that is what you want in the long term. Monogamous LDRs aren't any harder, IMO, than open ones... and considering that you wouldn't be okay with sharing eachother when you live in the same space, why would you be okay with sharing eachother when you don't? Use this time to build up your emotional attachment to eachother, and to strengthen the bond that you have. :) and, realistically, if you feel constrained now, you'll feel just as constrained when you're together. Distance doesn't make a lot of difference, IME, with regards to that. It's also hard to go from having that freedom to...not having that freedom.  I have two male partners, and one female partner. My primary partners are M/F, and they're married. My secondary/LDR partner is male. He's married as well, and he and his wife both have other relationships as well.  We do have jealousy now and again, yes. It happens with every relationship type! One partner gets more time than another, basic differences, mental space clouding your perception of the situation ... things like that. My girlfriend and I will be jealous of one another. She's jealous of me because our male partner and I have more in common than she does with either of us. I'm jealous of them because they're married and can be public with their relationship with eachother, and they share a bedroom. He doesn't tend to be jealous, but he *is* jealous when I visit my secondary/LDR partner, and I think he's jealous when our female partner goes and meets guys from OKCupid, but he doesn't really tell us about it.  The one thing that I am finding, is that the longer I'm in these relationships and the more we work with eachother, the more we trend towards 'compersion' - which is kind of the opposite of jealousy. My secondary/LDR partner will come to me to tell me about this amazing date he had, and I feel joy - because it made him happy, and it makes me happy when he's happy. Likewise, when my female partner goes out on her dates with guys from OKCupid, and comes back and tells me about them, it makes me happy - because she had fun, and that's a really, really good thing. :)  Does that answer your questions?",relationshipadvice

Fact is, when a person is having an affair, 9 times out of 10 when they break it off with their spouse, they break it off with the person they were having an affair with shortly after.    She wasn't with you because she loved you more than her husband, and she wasn't seeing you on the side because she made a mistake by marrying the wrong man.  Those are just things you told yourself.  She was with you because she felt confined and didn't like the accountability and stress of living day to day with her hubby, so you were her escape, both mental and physical.  Now that she's broke it off with him, there's nothing for her to ""escape"" from, so the whole basis of your relationship with her is undone.  In other words, the only reason she was with you was because she was married.    I'm not at all surprised to hear that she's gotten along well with many of your friends... it sounds like she gets along really well with all men in general.  You get my point?  She likes ""men"", not ""a man"".  What you should do is break if off with her, make a clean cut and get her out of your life.

I can honestly say I have never felt this way about a girl before; i'm not sure if it's love, but it's definitely the closest thing I've ever felt to it. She has all the qualities I would think of in a girl, she's cute, funny, but most importantly, smart.   Anyways, as the relationship has grown and evolved, I have learned more and more about her past. We are only 18 years old, but I have recently learned she was a major party goer in high school and has had 5 other fairly serious relationships in high school alone and has had sex multiple times with multiple guys starting from when she was 15-16.   Just today she told me how in the summer (2 months before we met) she went to a guys house who she met at after-prom for her graduation and was ""forced"" to have sex. I say ""forced"" because I immediately asked her if she said ""NO"" when she told me this, and she did not.   Obviously I am extremely confused because she said it was a traumatizing experience yet she did not say ""no"" once to his actions. Obviously this was before I even knew her, but it still rubs me the wrong way and it is eating me inside to know this. Also, she kept in contact with this guy (very loosely, maybe a few texts in total) even after we were dating.   She has made a huge effort to change who she is. She deleted her facebook at the end of the summer and made a new one with only new friends she met at university. I really believe she is trying her best to change who she is for the better.  Am I being selfish for feeling angry and almost on the verge of disgusted by her after learning about her past promiscuity? I know it's in the past and I perhaps shouldn't judge her based on her past actions, but they are haunting me from day to day it seems and I can't stop thinking about it. The thought of having sex with her after having learned all this stuff makes me feel extremely uneasy.   I just really need some input right now.",relationshipadvice

I was planning on coming back next semester, so I signed a lease at an apartment complex 2 minutes away from the school since uperclassmen can't live on campus due to not enough space. It's 4 bedrooms and the other three roommates have already done all of their paperwork. &gt; Anyways, I left school because of a medical condition and I don't need the lease anymore. I don't think I finalized the lease, I never did my security deposit nor did I send in the guarantor paperwork. &gt; A couple weeks ago the people from the apartment called me and told me that my lease hasn't been finalized and that I need to send in the guarantor papers and stuff to finalize it. &gt; I told them that I no longer needed the apartment, they told me since it was more than 48 hours since I signed the lease that I was still responsible for the rent and stuff. &gt; Anyways, I can't go back to school. I'm a lot happier and healthier here and the school wasn't good for my mental or physical health. So, my options are pay for the apartment and not even live there, or find someone to take over my lease, which I've been trying to do for about a month but I can't find anyone. &gt; So I guess I'm just asking for advice and have a few potentially dumb questions. &gt; 1) since I didn't finalize the lease, can they actually make me responsible for the rent &gt; 2) If I say that a medical condition has made me not able to live in the apartment anymore is that a potential loophole there and they can waive it or something? &gt; Any advice is helpful, I'm still kind of freaking out about it. I have a job here, but no car. So I'd be spending like 90% of my monthly paycheck on an apartment that I'm not even using. &gt;",legaladvice

I'm currently going through a ""break"" with my boyfriend, and after not talking for three days, he changed our facebook status to ""it's complicated."" One of his fucking friends ""liked"" it.  Did I provoke any of this? No. I did not speak to him, like he asked, for three days, nor did I log into facebook until yesterday so I could update my status to ""after four years in college, I FINALLY made a 3.5 GPA!"" I was proud of it, since I struggled through college. One minute later, he changes our status to **""it's complicated.""** He thinks it's justified, saying, ""well, all or nothing sucks."" I won't go into any further technicalities about our relationship, I just want to make a list called:   **Why changing your relationship status to ""it's complicated"" is the WORST.**  1. Whomever decides to change it in the first place is most likely trying to hurt the other person. They have put something very personal out into the public space, and then allowed for people to comment, like, discuss, make it part of their own lives through gossip, etc.  2. Now that it is in the public space, the affected party should wonder why the other person feels the need to have those details in the public space. Obviously, they were not trying to send that message only to you. Who else *needed* to see that?  3. Did the other person consult with you about this beforehand? If no, they are taking a point of power over you and the relationship by dictating the status of it for all to see. How do you take that back, exactly? Oh, it was complicated for a second there, but they're o.k. now? Probably not.  4. Again, if they did not consult with you about this beforehand, they did not have enough respect for you or the relationship to speak with you face to face like an ADULT about it first. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most couples above the age of 21 speak about their relationships face to face, or at least over the phone?  5. The other person wants attention from you and the rest of the facebook world, and has sought it by using you. Normally, you WILL get attention from these status changes, and the other party has used your relationship to seek it.  Well, I thought I would have more than that, but it looks like that's all I have for now. Please add, critique, discuss, etc. Are there *any* positive aspects to ""it's complicated?""

Advice?**  Original Post:   &gt; I attended a meeting yesterday (Tuesday) at 10am at a different retail store location, but the same chain I work for. About 25 other employees were there attending as well, including my store manager who happened to be sitting inches away from me. We all stand and introduce ourselves, and the meeting continues. About two hours in, I become incoherent. (I’m a type 1 diabetic, and my sugar level dropped rapidly.) I remember nothing after the first two hours, but I can barely piece together me standing in the hallway with my store manager telling me I had to leave because I was under the influence and clearly drunk. I was shocked, and remember feeling baffled. Then I blacked out again. That’s the only thing I remember until today (Wednesday) when I woke up from a coma in the hospital around 4pm &gt;  &gt; She apparently kicked me out of the meeting, and called me an Uber. I did somehow get into the Uber (not sure if she escorted me or not.) Uber never made it to my house My call log has about 10 calls I attempted to make to my mom, but I was incoherent and never actually spoke to her. My entire family has my gps, so my mom realized something was wrong, and rushed to my location. However the location wasn’t 100% accurate since the Uber was moving, so she’s panicking and looking everywhere.  &gt;  &gt; Meanwhile she calls my brother, begging him to help look. He calls my main retail store, they say I’m at a different location in a meeting. So my brother calls the store I was supposed to be at and asks where I am. A woman answers and says “oh.... her.... hold one second, let me get her manager.” Then the manager comes to the phone with a painful amount of attitude and says, “yeah, I had to send her home in an Uber because she was drunk out of her mind.” My brother was pissed and said “are you fucking kidding me? You know she’s diabetic right!!?? This is a matter of life and death CALL THE UBER RIGHT NOW!” Then she was shocked and called the Uber but he wouldn’t answer.  &gt;  &gt; The Uber drove miles past my house down a road with forests on each side. (Also, the Uber had me for over an hour, when my apartment was 10 minutes from the retail store.) My mom already had an ambulance following her, and my brother and mom finally get to the Uber at the same time. I was laying in the back seat, my pants were unzipped and he was holding a blue napkin. He was startled and said he was helping me pee. My brother and parents rush to me, and my eyes were wide open, but I was barely breathing. My left cheek is cut and scraped, and my left eye is bruised. He said I fell when I tried to pee. My mom is hysterical and crying, meanwhile the ambulance is getting me and putting on the oxygen mask etcetera.  &gt;  &gt; I was rushed to intensive care. They did a cat scan, a rape kit, and blood tests. Nothing was in my system. No alcohol or drugs were in my system. (I don’t think I was raped, they just suggest I do it.)  &gt;  &gt; The doctors initially weren’t worried, but since I hadn’t woken up in over 24 hours, they said I had a 50/50 chance of surviving. My brother told me that was the second time my mom had a breakdown.  &gt;  &gt; So I finally wake up, in shock, asking where I am and why I’m in a hospital. The doctors come to me and ask me a ton of questions to make sure I’m coherent. After talking with my mom for a while, I grab my phone and I had a message from my boss to come into work at 8am tomorrow (Thursday) to “talk.” &gt;  &gt; I was off work Wednesday anyway.  &gt;  &gt; I work with all women, and I know she was going around telling everyone how “drunk” I was. But that isn’t even the issue. All of this could’ve been prevented if she just would’ve called my emergency contact.  &gt;  &gt; Now I’m embarrassed, ashamed, frustrated. And just overall not sure what to do?     --- LocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice

[The backstory](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1efjxp/first_post_terrible_night/)  We are currently both in individual counselling... Myself for working on my assertiveness, and her, on an issue she will not share with anyone but her therapist (I was told that it does not concern me). According to her, she needs time to work on her issue, and that I need to be understanding.   I respect her decision not to share, but while we are working on ourselves, I feel like we are growing further and further apart.  I mentioned to her many times that while separate counselling was a step in the right direction, we really needed to work on our marriage (8 years - 2 kids). Her response is always that she needs time to work on her issue - give me space, give me time, don't touch or kiss me.   Meanwhile, things have been less then stellar at home. For example, she kicked me out of the house last week because I was taking a road trip with our kids to see my family (she didn't want to join us), and she irrationally thought I was trying to take the kids away from her. I'll leave out much of the drama that ensued.   Anyhow, she left today for a weekend away with her girlfriends and I'm planning on confronting her when she returns... Basically, we need to go to couple counselling, or else we need to take an extended break from each other.  Even though I believe this to be the right course of action, I keep thinking that it will only complicate things.   I feel like she's buying time to plan her exit strategy, but I'm not ready to call it quits.  We have this big storm cloud that's following us, and she won't address it.  What to do?  Is giving her more time the proper thing to do?  Am I a coward for not wanting to give her 6-12 months for her to figure out if she wants to work on our marriage?  tl;dr - My wife will not work on our decaying marriage until she figures out her own issues.

lvzt9,lvzt9,confusedbutgrateful,"I'm a guy in my late 20's and I'm a virgin, I've never been in any relationship or intimate with anyone in my life. I've suffered from crippling depression for most of my adult life, and in this time I've pent up a lot of dark things about myself.  She is slightly older then me. Has been in multiple relationships, most lasting several years. Her previous relationships have ended with her totally heart broken, and suffering several breakdowns (to the extent she physically couldn't move for months). She is currently in a relationship for 2 years, she is buying a house with her current boyfriend but says this is not for life and is more for stability and financial reasons.  Up until a few months ago we were just co-workers. We would talk, be friendly and help each other out, there was nothing unusual between us at all. But she suddenly started getting closer to me. She would start to gently touch me, jokingly flirt with me, and go out of her way to talk to me. Given my non-history with such things I was confused, I knew she was in a relationship but I didn't know if she was flirting or not.  I eventually decided to find out, and I did so by opening up to her. She told me that she wasn't flirting, but just wanted me to open up as she saw I was depressed. But over the last few months we have been continously talking and opening up to each other, and I mean this in the most vulnerable way any person could. We've told each other every possible intimate details you could imagine, and given our two life histories there is a lot of them.  We are now extremely close to each other and are emotionally intimate, we could share absolutely any part of ourselves to each other and know the other will be there for us. During all of this I have told her several times that I love her, and I do. I love her in the closest way you possibly could without being romantically involved. Yes I even told her this despite her still being in a relationship, as we are that close that we can share such things openly.  However when I have told her about my feelings she remains neutral and doesn't want to address the topic. She hasn't told me if she is interested in me in that way or not, and specifically has told me she doesn't want to answer such a question. The closest (paraphrased) answer I've got from her is ""things change, and one day there could maybe be something"".  Now as you may imagine given my non-existent love life this whole situation baffles me. I'm unsure why if you are in a relationship you would go out of your way to get someone to open up, share your most intimate thoughts and feelings with them but then refuse to tell them if you are interested in a relationship with them or not.  I do not know if she just needs a friend or not. She has told me that the only real friends she has and she can share herself with are her boyfriend and me. This all makes for a weird relationship triangle, I love her. She may love me, but she may love him. He knows nothing about me and her, and he may love her.  I think she is unsure of her current relationship, and given how close the two of us are I think she knows we could have something very deep together. But that she is unsure if she should leave her current relationship or not. I may however be completely misreading the situation, and she is simply needed a friend who isn't her boyfriend.  My question to you lovely folk out there is to ask this. Is it normal for people to have or look for such intimate friends while being in a relationship? Why do you believe she is doing this, and what do you believe she is looking for?  For the record I'm not expecting her to leave her relationship, I've not asked her to do this. I'd be willing to wait for her, but I'm scared I'm leading myself down into a place where I will get hurt badly. I've even told her I'm scared of this, but she still refuses to give me a straight answer on what she feels and what she wants.  Thank you for listening.",relationshipadvice

67d8s4,67d8s4,Geekychickz,"Hello!  I have a question for a friend.  She lives in the United states in Missouri.  She was hired today for a job through a contract agency.  The company that hired her made her sign paperwork agreeing to two things that I think are HUGE red flags; but she was felt pressured into signing them and being a very shy person didn't know how to handle the situation.  The two red flags are:  1. They don't actually pay her a salary, they pay her a portion of the sales of services (basically dog walking/picking up dog poop).  They told her it was like commission where her own actions would determine her percentage; but shes not selling a product she's performing a service for the company.   2. They made her sign a contract saying that if she leaves the position for any reason (including being fired) she owes them 500$.    My question is if this is legal (especially #2) and is there a legal grace period for getting out of an employment contract?   I know that in Missouri there is a 3 day grace period if you sign a contract for goods or services (i.e. you sign up for a gym due to aggressive sales tactics and want out of the contract the next day).  Is there any law or protection for employees that sign employment contracts?   I know Missouri is an At-Will employment state.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  She is absolutely frantic with worry because they got her into the interview with promises of a good salary and working with animals and now she's terrified she'll be working for pennies to pick up dog poop. I told her I would ask Reddit because I just don't know enough about this to help and all I can find with google-fu is the 3 day grace period for goods/services.   Warmest Regards,  Geekychickz  P.S. She signed the contract today.  If there is a 3 day grace period; she'll need to know by Wednesday",legaladvice

If you think something is likely to hurt her, don't do it! Take it easy until she's genuinely happy to say ""Have a good time on your date!"".  Don't try to legislate emotions. Rules like ""You can't be jealous"" or ""You can't fall in love with someone else"" never work. People feel what they feel. Understand that an open relationship means some unexpected, difficult, complicated emotions may come up, and be prepared for that.  Always focus on keeping your relationship with her strong and happy. If casual sex with someone else starts feeling like a higher priority than keeping your girlfriend feeling confident and happy about her relationship with you, then you need to have a long talk about whether you want to stay together.   Also, don't be surprised if you either never go back to being monogamous or have a really hard time going back to it, especially if either of you forms a close emotional relationship with someone else.

In May, we tried to reconnect as friends (we are both dating other people now). We were definitely having a great time hanging out and doing things together, as well as occasionally talking (not arguing) about what we went through in the past. Both of our current SOs were cool with it, and personally I had zero inclination to cheat anyways.  A few weekends ago, we went to a pub and had drinks, got a little tipsy. She ends up telling me that she ""needs"" to tell me that her current relationship is not going to go anywhere, and that it's temporary. She also went on to say that her current SO already said he loves her, and she said it too, but ""didn't mean it."" Then some more things about how her mom is happy that we are spending time together again. *Then* she says that she still wants to work on her relationship with her current SO and that she cares a lot about him.  Keep in mind, there is almost no reason for her bringing this up as far as my actions go. I have pretty much no interest in knowing the intimate details of her relationship issues, and so in response I make that clear to her. I feel like these issues are her own business, and honestly, that I'm afraid that I will start getting emotionally involved in them.  I could tell that she was getting very emotional about it (augmented by the alcohol as well), so we agreed to instead talk about it when we're both sober.  Since that night, she has avoided responding to me, and has only briefly talked to me at her own convenience. I had tried giving her a few calls, asking how she was doing, if she did still want to talk, etc. and received silence for the most part. In fact, it seemed like I was somehow to blame for her emotional outburst. Weirder yet is that the few times she talked to me, she has acted cheery, almost as if she hadn't said all of those things, and that my newfound bewilderment is unjustified.  Now, I'm not a fan of the stress that comes with these mind games. I went through this enough during our relationship, and I have a lot of other things on my mind career-wise and in my own new relationship. I am almost certain that I don't want to build this ""friendship"" anymore.  **My question is this:** Do I just leave it be, say nothing and keep moving? We have a few mutual friends, and we just recently re-connected through social networks (FB, Twitter, etc). Do I just leave these connections there? I don't really want her to know much about my personal life any longer, nor do I want to know about hers. At the same time, I hate the idea of burning bridges, and feel like that is always the easy (and melodramatic) way out.  Hence, my confusion.  **TL;DR: When you have decided that a mending friendship with someone is no longer worth working on, is it better to be passive and move on mentally, or to actually voice my feelings and cut all ties?**",relationshipadvice

fscn7,fscn7,jealousbitch,"Reddit, all of my past relationships have escalated into emotional abuse and cheating..(them cheating on me). I have been with a great guy for a couple of years now and he treats me great. The problem is, I always end up getting jealous and/or paranoid when he is talking to other girls. He is a friendly guy and has a lot of female friends but has never given me reason not to trust him.  The problem is, when he is talking on the phone or internet with a girl, I start getting really jealous and bitchy, stomping around and snapping at him even though he has offered to let me look through his account and even given me the password. (I haven't done it because his offering makes me feel guilty) I feel like such an asshole, but I don't know how to stop the jealousy from popping up and it's making me feel like a total bitch over nothing.  We have had no problems besides this. He is always telling me what a great partner I am and I feel the same about him, but I can tell he is getting sick and tired of my fits of rage over nothing and I don't want to lose him.  What should I do?

OP points out in the body that Stub Hub charged $700 in fees.  So, presumably, they are asking for the $600 value of the original tickets back (from what OP was presumably paid for the ""sale""), cost of equivalent replacements for the customer, and a fee.  In that context, I wouldn't find the fee ask unreasonable - if they hadn't sold tickets that were pulled back off the platform.",legaladvice
1ub7d1,1ub7d1,whatadoozy,"Howdy y'all. I'm not going to spare details because that's where most of my depression comes from. Anyway, lets get on with it.    I'm a 20 year old engineering student whose life hasn't been the same since my last relationship. About half way through my senior year of high school, I met a girl who recently transferred in. She was beautiful but troubled. I knew I had to talk to her. We were friends for about 4 months. During this time, I began to fall in love. She was artistic, sweet, funny, intelligent and most importantly, comfortable. We could talk for hours and it would seem like minutes. Nothing was out of bounds for us. We were both a little demented, shared a similar sense of humor, and loved doing the same things. To put it simply, we just clicked. Perfectly. Something that I had never happened in previous relationships.  Eventually this friendship turned into more, we developed feelings, eventually she broke up with her abusive ex for good. Fast forward a few more weeks and she took my virginity, and we began dating. The sex became fantastic under her instruction; kinky, dirty, passionate, and long. Honestly everything was perfect. But did I mention she told me early on she was bipolar? Yeah, I underestimated the gravity of that significantly.    Eventually the rest of the year and summer passed. We were two people in love. So naturally, we said that we would give the long-distance thing a shot after I went off to University 2 hours away. It was really rough, we were used to seeing each other almost every day. It was hard, but when she would come visit me over the weekend It was all perfect again. Eventually communication just weakened and wasn't the same, red flags went up, so I snooped. I found out she cheated on me more than once less than a month after I left. I dumped her.   But I just couldn't get over her. It wasn't like my other relationships where I cried, thought everything through, and then moved on. I had a deep connection with this girl and I was very shocked when I realized I still wanted her back despite what she had done. It went against all my moral values. A few weeks went by of no communication before she wrote a long story to me about how she messed up, partially because of her own uncertainty and the distance, partially because of alcohol, and partially because she had stopped taking her medication. She said she wanted me back. She said she couldn't bear to lose the first guy she actually loved and who actually cared about her and she hated herself for destroying it. She felt awful, and I could hear the pain in her voice when I humored her phone calls. It seemed reasonable, and I attributed the behaviour to the fact that she wasn't in the right state of mind, and I forgave the cheater. She made every effort in the world to mend our relationship. She saw a therapist regularly and started a new medication. She said she couldn't bear to lose the only person she ever connected to as deeply as I did.  She stopped hanging out with any guys, called me every day without fail, texted me good morning and good night every day. She wrote me poems and letters, made me art, and did whatever she had to do to make me feel secure. It worked slowly. 6 months went by, and I finally felt pretty secure and able to move past everything. We still cuddled and everything was alright. We made stupid faces and voices to eachother, and debated our favorite ways to hold hands. We loved going out and exploring together, and we did pretty much every activity under the sun. The sex was still absolutely mind blowing and frequent. Then I received a really shitty phone call. She went to her gynecologist who noticed something strange. She had a sample taken. She eventually was confirmed to have HPV. We stopped normal sex and a few months went by and I developed symptoms. Shit.    I started treatment, and I felt like we grew closer through tragedy I guess. Our relationship was stable for a long time, and I did my aldera treatment and focused on school. After about 8 months of treatment, I was eventually clear, and she cleared up too. However, bitterness about the cheating came back hard, despite the fact that there was no way to know for sure who she got it from or if she had had it previously. It reflected in my attitude and I'd bring it up. It was hard not too despite everything. I started smoking weed more often to cope with the depression resulting from the STD and everything else including the stress of my engineering program. It helped me sleep and would remind me that life wasn't so serious and bad. I still managed to maintain a 3.5 GPA.     After that summer and soon into first semester of my sophomore year of college, we decided our relationship was just too strained and toxic to keep continuing. I couldn't completely get over every bad thing that had happened, and she couldn't live with feeling like an awful person with what she had done to me. We were both very busy with school as well. So despite the fact we loved each other deeply, we broke up and remained friends, still talking often. We still consider each other soul mates and agree that maybe in a few years we can give it one more shot if we still feel deeply for each other. We needed clean slates.    Since then I've been clear from HPV for a semester. I met a new girl who was sweet, funny, and pretty, but I cut things off after a few dates before sex because of the STD situation. My doctor said If I was clear for a few months, that ""there was no medical reason in his experience to disclose"" but I don't feel completely comfortable with that. Even after all this time, I still couldn't shake my feelings for my ex. I still love her. Obviously I can't date someone new with these feelings, it's not fair to them.    So here I am now. I want to stop smoking weed, as I feel I need all the brain power I can get to finish my engineering curriculum, but I feel it keeps me sane and is better than some depression medication. But I'm still depressed. I can't be with the girl I love because of too many issues. Future dating seems unappealing because of my emotional feelings and the new issue of dating with an STD. I don't know what to do. I just want to be happy again. Should I see a therapist? Should I quit women for a while and focus on just school and working out? Will I be stuck on STD dating websites for the rest of my life now? I don't even know what strain of HPV I had, so I don't want to acquire a new one... I can't stay focused on my school work because of my drama, and I'm scared my GPA will suffer, especially doing it completely on my own during this depression I've been stuck in. I need advice. About my whole situation. I'm sorry for the wall of text, but you guys need to know ALL the details. Help. I'm sick of feeling like a different person than I was before everything :/",relationshipadvice

cwwrmpl,3s6bhv,Circle_Dot,"Go to Safeway, but write this down first. Print a statement that shows the transaction.  Ask for the ""Booth"" Manager Sun-Thursday in the morning. They may be on their lunch around 9-11am depending on when they get there.  Tell them you were charged, refunded and never received the money. If it was a debit card you used, you should've been refunded cash as Safeway only refunds back to the credit card. If your debit has credit logos but you used a PIN number, you still should've been refunded cash. Safeways refund system uses credit and they are charged a transaction fee for this and they avoid as per CO policy.   When you talk to Booth manager, be nice. It makes it hard to want to help you if you are being a jerk.  Show them your statement and that no refund has been given. Offer to call your bank and hand over the phone so an employee of the bank can verify for them if they don't trust your statement.  Tell them they can also verify transaction went through on the ""paymaster"" report. They will know what this is. They will also be able to see if the refund went through on their end on the same report, right after the initial transaction. My guess from experience, the refund won't be there as something happened and transaction was voided or canceled because you left before it could finish. Refunds require an override and unless it was a manager checking you would've had to wait longer. If you were being an ass about being in a hurry, the checker probably just told you it was refunded to get you out of their face. Refunds take more time. Why did you refund after making purchase? This seems strange to me. If you wanted said product and you just paid for it, why not walk away? Or if you were truly in a hurry, why did you stand in line and swipe your payment card to seconds later having to leave? Your story smells.  Anyway, make sure you have a club card or phone number linked to one. Because if they can't find your transaction on the paymaster, they can look it up on the ""dd controller"" or ""cc controller"" in the register journal. They can use the F10 search option to search your name or club number.  Once they find this they should be able to give you a refund.   Remember, don't be an asshole. This person had nothing to do with your problem, but they can fix it.  Also, refunds typically take 3-5 business days to show up in your account. It's really strange, because money leaving your account is instant right?  Well it actually makes sense. Your bank is actually taking money out of your account and sending it to Safeway when you buy something. Safeway doesn't get that money instantly. The reduction in your account is instantaneous because that is something your bank controls and is doin you a favor by reflecting the pending balance as your actual balance so you don't go negative or double spend. Well, on a refund Safeway is taking money out of their account and sending it to your bank. Just like you, Safeways account is decreases instantly. Once all payments are reconciled does the money actually show up at its intended location account. I am sure you been to some businesses and bought something and that transaction didn't show up for a day or two. I bet you didn't complain about that?  In the end, Safeway doesn't want to steal your money. They will be happy to give it back if there was an error somewhere. Don't forget that every check stand has a camera, so they can check them too, to see if you left without the product.",legaladvice

We live in a college town where apartments fill up *fast*, so to get your first choice of apts you pretty much have to start making decisions 5-6 months in advance. Actually if I want to secure my current apt for a second year I have to let them know by mid-December.  I suggested moving in together because 1) We like spending time together 2) it seems like the next logical step in our relationship and 3) I want to find out if we're compatible living together.  When I brought this up with my BF, I prefaced it by saying, ""I'm going to ask you a question, and before you answer it, I want you to think about it for a while and answer me as honestly as you can."" The reason for this is because my BF sometimes has difficulty admitting to me and to himself what he really feels/wants if he thinks it'll hurt my feelings. He said he didn't need to think about it and that it was a good idea.  Fast forward to a few weeks later - last night. We haven't talked about it *at all* since I initially brought it up. I ask BF if he's thought any more about us living together and if he has any requirements or specifications for an apartment. He said he didn't have any at all, and then tried to talk about something else. I asked him a couple more questions about moving in together and every single time he just kind of provided a non-answer and quickly changed the subject. I asked him if he was being completely honest with me and himself when he said he wanted to move in together and he said he was. Asked him why he kept changing the subject and he said he wasn't trying to, he just talked about something else whenever there was a lull in the conversation (there weren't any). Later when I tried to bring it up again he wouldn't look at me and started talking about next weekend plans instead. When I asked him why he kept changing the subject *again* he said he'd rather not talk about it when we weren't at a computer to be able to look at apartments (we were in bed at the time.)  I just don't know what to make of it. I might just be paranoid.

It went fast, I mean REALLY fast, she told me she loved me on our third date, I said it back because I didnt want to lose her. I wasn't completely honest with her in the beginning because I didn't tell her I was married before, she found out before I could tell her by reading my archived facebook messages without me knowing, she had a tantrum and pulled a knife on me, I calmed her down of course and we moved on. Fast forward two months, she's pregnant, so shit just got real and I do what I think was best and agree to help raise the baby, we go on our merry way for about two more months, and then it got worse.      I had some problems adjusting after I got out of the army, so to cope I would drink copious amounts of alcohol to deal with my crippling depression, until one day my cousin, a fellow vet, told me to try Cannabis and said that it helped him a lot, and like magic my mood improved, I was more positive and life seemed good again. (this took place in 2010-2011). She hates Cannabis, she thinks only weak people use it and forbids me from using it under threat of losing her and my son.

d0o9m7j,48wxlc,casedude,"Yes, we did re-home our cats. We actually spent a lot of time (looking on and off for over 6 months) finding the 'perfect' candidate for them. We asked everyone we knew and no one was willing to take them in. There were no no-kill shelters near us without a giant waiting list, which we obviously regret not signing up for.   It was a specific event that happened a couple weeks before the adoption that was the real catalyst for us to find a new home for them. As I said in another post, one of the cats in particular would constantly beg to be let out onto our second story deck. Our cats had all of their claws, which means they could climb. And climb it did. A few weeks prior it had climbed up to the third story deck and whined from the deck because it couldn't get down. Luckily, the neighbor above us was home and said we could come upstairs and grab the cat from his apartment. It was worrying because the neighbor seemed okay about it but we weren't sure if he would mention anything to the apartment complex (because the cats are supposed to be de-clawed in our apartment complex). We refused to let the cat out for the next couple of weeks, but her constant whining at the slider door to our deck was just too much. Typically I would go out and stay with them to make sure they didn't climb up, but this particular instance I wasn't out on the deck and she climbed up to the third floor deck again. Unfortunately this time our neighbor was not home. We went up to his door and knocked and no one answered. My only option at that point was to climb onto his deck. So I climbed onto the neighbors deck, but there were two problems; I can't climb down the deck with the cat in my hands and his slider door was locked so I couldn't go through his apartment. Luckily, there was a giant pine tree not more than 5 feet from the deck. My girlfriend stood at the foot of the tree with a blanket and I tossed the cat into the pine tree, which completely muffled her fall and my girlfriend caught the cat without any problems.   The cat was completely fine, I wouldn't have done any thing to hurt it, but we were very worried that we would be forced to de-claw the cats, and we decided it was best that we find them a new, larger home where the cat had the space it wanted to roam around.   You need to realize that there were a lot of variables that went into the decision to re-home them.

dcveplb,5q0m8b,geekgirl1225,"I'm responding with the assumption you are in the US.  This is a completely normal recourse for most companies to request that the victim of fraud file a police report. The reasoning is that without the police report, the company could be liable for releasing private information (think someone who has a protection order or even just basic privacy issues).  The next steps are that the teachers (both) should submit or have submitted chargebacks to their respective credit card companies. This will ensure they are not out the cash at the end of the day.  As someone who does not work for law enforcement, there is very little you can do to investigate who might have done this based on the credit card statements from the teachers. The companies (XBox/Microsoft in this case) will rarely budge on sharing account information with just anyone who calls up. As a private citizen, I should hope you would agree. As an educator who is trying to help a possibly troubled student, I understand why this is frustrating.  I assume (again) that you are hesitant to file police reports because you do not want to get the student in legal trouble. You would rather try to have a sit down with the student and their guardian (parent or otherwise). Here's a suggestion: talk to your school resource officer or any other officer who you've worked with in the past and explain the situation. The investigating officer assigned the case can take this into consideration. Additionally, with the teachers having filed a chargeback with their credit card company, the ""person"" now out the cash is...Microsoft. It's unlikely that Microsoft would want to press charges with the amounts you're explaining. If your jurisdiction still sees the teachers as the victims in this case -- and they agree -- they can refuse to file charges at any point during the investigation.  The moral of my explanation is to actually have a conversation with an officer to explain your motivation for the investigation. I'd wager 99.99999% of police officers don't join the force to solely place kids in jail. They want to help them out before they become a bigger issue. At this point in the student's life, there are several resources that can turn their life around. You are one of them. If you talk to one officer who says no, work up the food chain. Their sergeant will see the value in helping the kid out before they get too off track.  Obligatory I am not a lawyer but work in law enforcement.  Edit: I misread and thought that OP was a teacher and not a student. Same advice still applies, but my appreciation statement was geared towards an educator. Now I'll just say: get good grades! Work hard! Pass the info along to your parent to discuss with the school...",legaladvice

po7lb,po7lb,,"I will try to be as brief as possible. Last June, my relationship (5 years) with the mother of my son ended. I was pretty down for a minute, but I knew it was for the best and there is no drama with custody, visitation, etc.   Fast forward to the middle of December. After being really reluctant to date again (I had a couple of bad okaycupid dates and one bar hookup), I met a super nice girl at a bar in my city. She is my age (35), financially squared away and cute. We exchanged numbers with the understanding that we would not go out until after Xmas due to hectic schedules. Right around the same time my company hires a new girl to work on our clerical staff. I generally don't pay a lot of attention to these girls (they're always girls), because their manager is major biatch and the department has high turnover. This girl immediately starts flirting with me. Seeking me out multiple times as day (we work in different areas of the building) and timing her breaks with mine to be near me. I was still skeptical of the situation, but I decided to say fuck it and invite her to meet my friend and I for happy hour. She says great and then flakes the next today. I didn't give it much thought. She texts two days later and says sorry and that she wants to hang out again.   Christmas passes and we continue to make small talk at work. I go out with the other woman and we totally hit it off. I see her again a few days later and it's really obvious that she likes me a lot. Later in the week (week after new years) I invite dudes from work to go out to watch a game.  We make our plans and as I'm leaving I casually mention it to the younger work girl. She ends up coming late and we stay at the bar after our coworkers leave. I eventually say I need to leave, but we can get one last drink at the bar near my place. We have a drink and are leaving the bar when I wish her goodnight. She asks if she can come over. I say no and explain that I have to work early. She then DEMANDS to come over. I'm hammered and so is she. She comes over and we have pretty bad drunk sex. I woke up at five am confused about the person in my bed and realize that I'm too hungover to go to work. I call in sick and we hang out at my place until 5pm or so. We have amazing conversation the whole time (no sex or even kissing). I make her leave due to the fact that I had another engagement that night. She calls me first the next morning and asks me out to breakfast. We eat and then proceed to have the most amazing day ever. The walk all over the city, talk, and finally grab a drink around 6pm. Things are going really great so I ask her if she wants to do some ecstasy that I had stashed for a special occasion. Another amazing night.   I continue seeing the other woman we eventually start sleeping together. The sex is really great, but I have this strong emotional attraction to the younger girl. The coworker and I continue the same pattern. Amazing conversation, lots of fun and laughs, and the weekly drunken hookup. I eventually had to tell the 35 year old that I wasn't interested in a serious relationship. The took it surprisingly well and said she wanted to continue a sexual relationship. This was the situation up until last week. Sex a few nights a week with the older one... strong feelings and attraction to the younger coworker with occasional sex. The coworker was insistent that she meet and spend a day with me and my son. Again, a great day and I really feel like things are heading to a good place (probably a really bad idea in retrospect).   Last Wednesday I take the coworker to a concert for her birthday (23rd). She both got pretty hammered and ended up at her place. As we were going to bed, she gets kind of nervous and awkward. She blurts out: ""i can't be your girlfriend."" I was drunk and just said okay, why not. She explained that she moved away from her home town to be independent and single. She said that she was developing feelings for me (read love) and couldn't be in a relationship. She mentioned that meeting my son only made her feelings for me more intense. I didn't really try to change her mind. I was drunk and hurt, so decided sleep was my best option at that point. When I woke up for work I woke her up and asked her to run her feelings by me again. She basically said to forget about what she said. I knew that was bs. I basically tried to reassure her that I had no expectations of her other than hanging out. I never directly told her that I had serious feeling for her in the first place. So I just repeated several times: let's just hang out, see where things go, no pressure... Things seemed totally normal at work that day. She brought me something to drink. Walked with me to catch the bus home, etc. She initiated plans for two days later for breakfast (we had plans to attend a party that night). She shows up for breakfast in a really bad mood. She tells me she cannot to go the party because she is going to stop drinking for a while (and doesn't want to be around booze - the lack of self control is a major red flag). I say great... I totally support people making healthy choices. Her attitude is sort of a downer so we finish eating and I say I'm going home. She says she wants to hang more and basically said the negative attitude needs to go away or I'm out. We then proceed the have another amazing day of conversation, walks, long intense eye contact, etc. I am purposefully distant physically. She eventually leaves to meet a friend and I realize: OH FUCK... I love this girl.   I have no idea what to do. I need to protect my emotions, because I don't think she knows what she wants or if she is even capable of having one. All I know is that I feel more deeply connected to this girl than I ever have to anyone. My only plan at this point is to blow her off a bit. I don't respond to all of her texts and always with a long delay. I'm not going to try and make plans with at all. She needs to make an effort to see me.   Any input? Any ladies want to take a crack at what might be going through her mind? We have a 12 year age difference... Is that impossible to overcome? I'm still a decent looking guy and I'm not nervous around women... So this is not a forever alone scenario.  I think I love this girl.

I just ended a very messy year-long relationship. I started dating this girl last summer. We dated until mid-November when she told me that she was unhappy. She broke up with me. However, I knew that she had been in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship in high school that causes her to have trust issues. These trust issues allowed her to make friends easily, but to intentionally sabotage relationships when she thought that she was getting too close / vulnerable. So I decided to stick with her.  From November on, we saw each other nearly everyday, went on dates, were exclusive sexually -- basically dating without the official title. During that time, I put up with a lot of poor treatment. Not out of desperation or low self-esteem, but because I wanted to show her that I was trustworthy. I'm going to write about the things I let her get away with because part of me thinks it will be cathartic and it is necessary to paint the picture of the relationship.  Very frequently we would make plans to see each other on a weekend night, and then something would come up and she wouldn't show. Many of her excuses were legit (ex. her best friend needed her help and it took longer than she thought it would) others weren't.   In the winter, we had plans to see Nutcracker together. I had already bought the tickets when she informed me that she had been asked to a fraternity formal on the same night, and felt obligated to attend that (she came over afterward, so I know there was no cheating).  Most of her closest friends are guys, so she spent large amounts of time with her male friends (some of which had girlfriends, others didn't). During the majority of this time, she would not text me back.  Recently, at my fraternity formal, she spent the first half hour or so dancing with her friends who were there and neglecting me. I had been drinking at this event, so by the time she wanted to dance with me I wasn't interested. This sparked a fight.  Following that, she decided that she did not want me at her sorority formal because she didn't want to have a repeat of my formal. She asked her male friend from home. I was not ok with this. We had an argument about it, and it created a lot of distance.  Her formal was this weekend. I found out that she made out with her date. She was on sober duty, so she was conscious of what she was doing.   Having written all of that out, I see how ridiculous it looks that I put up with her for as long as I did. In my defense, I saw that she was treating me poorly, but she told me she loved me and cared about me deeply. I felt the same, so I chose to be patient (very patient) with her. The nature of her past abusive relationship was such that I was always inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. Additionally, she is an amazing person to be around, has many similar (and nerdy) interests to mine, and the sex was great. So it's not like she has no redeeming qualities, it's just that being devoted to me was not one of them.   Anyway, last night we got into a fight (at the risk of revealing too much personal information, I had been drinking heavily because my university's basketball team just lost the national championship), which ended with me saying ""You're a terrible person. Fuck you."" and then hanging up.   Intellectually, I understand that she was a destructive force in my life and that I shouldn't put myself in a situation which is so emotionally abusive for me. However, emotionally, I miss her, and I hate to think that I hurt her or damaged her more than she was when I met her.   So, with that, reddit, I'm turning to you for your opinions. Affirmation that I did the right thing would be great, but honesty is probably the best policy. Please and Thank You.  Sorry if this is not very coherent. I did my best. And, also, sorry that this is pretty long.   tl;dr You probably won't be able to offer the judgment that I'm looking for without reading above. Thanks for reading this though.",relationshipadvice

1klg3t,1klg3t,,"Me and my boyfriend have been together almost a year, there were a few problems at first but we've worked through a lot of them and still trying to sort out some - one being that he feels like he's not important to me. We have broken up a few times but because we love eachother we have always got back together. If we break up again I don't think I could do it all again and get back with him though.  The problem I'm having is that he is quite stubborn and will never admit any fault. For example last night we agreed I would go to his after getting back from a friends and I'd stay the night, we never agreed a time. When I got back (a hour or so later than i expected) I texted him to make sure it was still ok for me to come. He said no it was too late (even though I've gone to his at that time before - it was around 9.30pm). He said he'd been waiting around for me and had given up. I apologised that I was late and agreed that I should have text him sooner to say I was running late. At no point did he text me to find out where I was. He said he'd not gone out with friends because I was coming over and I said I could still come over but he refused and said he will see me tomorrow.  I pointed out that he had done a similar thing last week and I didn't get annoyed but he dismissed that and said that I was making a big deal out of it and he wasn't annoyed but now he is. I said sorry a lot of times and kept asking him if I could come over because I really wanted to see him and had been looking forward to it all day  but he still said no. I feel like he is punishing me by not letting me see him because I made a small mistake. There's no reasoning with him and once he's made his mind up that is it. Or am I in the wrong? I know I should have come back earlier or text him but I don't think I deserve to be in the dog house this much for it. I am going to his in a few hours and not sure what to do. Part of me thinks he's just going to end it over this tiny thing but if he doesn't then I either have to agree with him or find a way if getting him to see my side of things. Any advice? I have no idea whether I'm 100% at fault or not.",relationshipadvice

1tbcqc,1tbcqc,HollyVictoria,"So here goes, a few weeks ago my partner and I started having problems, he was just acting differently and things weren't the same as they had been for the past 10 months. When we finally got talking he said he thought he was depressed, it had nothing to do with me but he couldn't find a way to be happy in anything anymore. We tried to keep going and then three weeks ago I asked if it would work, he wasn't sure but came over to talk. He sat on my bed for 15 minutes and just cried. Didn't say anything,  that's when I knew something was wrong. He said it would be best if we were apart, he said he didn't feel the same about me, he no longer loved me. Eventually by the end of the conversation he was so upset and didn't want to go tjat he realised what we had was too good to let go. We gave it another go, he really tried and I thought things were better. Unfortunately one week later we broke up, he said it wasn't fair on either of us and he just doesn't feel the same for him.  I have no idea what to do, I'm still madly in love with this guy and don't want to let him go so easily.  I don't understand how you can love someone one week but not the next. Is this possible?  I have to be there for him too, I want to be to helo with whatever is going on in his head, I'm the only one who knows everything that's going on but I just want us to get back together.   When we were together we spoke about moving in together,  getting married and he was so sure about us and everything was amazing,  we both thought we had found our true loves and promised we would never break up. This is why it's so hard for me to accept that he just doesn't love me anymore.   I don't know if anyone has any advice or has even read though this.  In my head I feel we should get back together one day because of how great we were and how I know we both felt. More and more in my heart im feeling it'll never happen and I don't know what to do.   We still talk all the time and he has said things like 'if I didn't feel like this then I know I would want to be with you' I don't think he can because he says he didn't love me. He said 'I know I think this is worth fixing and saving'. He is going skiing next week on a trip we were supposed to go on for about a month which really scares me as he might realise it's good we broke up and he never wants this again. Its going to be a really hard 4 weeks. He said last night 'I can't say we will definitely get back together when I'm back, I don't know if we ever will. I just don't know how I'm feeling' it was nice to hear because it means he's thought about it but I just don't know what to do or how to try and get over this.  It feels good to write it all down but I feel like I want to shake him. I know he remembers how good it was he says it was the best but there is so much going on with him he needs to sort out. I just feel like I'm being selfish wanting this. Of course I want him to be better but I don't know if I'm just supposed to wait around for that day if it ever comes and he realises he does love me and what he's thrown away.",relationshipadvice

They did the roof pretty quick and lost a bunch of my gutter guards (not the worst, but still).   The siding took almost 3 months of no-shows and broken promises. They finally did it but screwed it up royally. The work was incredibly sloppy and they damaged a window frame and screen to boot. On top of that they moved a support for an awning on my house and when they reattached it they moved it about 4"" down so it sagged. It sagged so bad the door underneath it can't open all the way. They came out and cleaned up some of the sloppy work after I told them I was withholding the check my insurance company gave me along with the paperwork they have requested from them. They have my deductable already but that's not much comparatively. They have repeatedly no showed to fix the damage, had me speak to 3 different contacts who have implied they weren't responsible for damage to saying they would take care of it no matter what. Of course they haven't actually done anything yet.  Tonight I discovered dry rot termites running up and down the awning and door frame. They had not been there before but because of their sloppy work and incorrect reattachment of the support there has been exposed wood.   Thanks for reading along this whole bit.

At the end of the day though, it is almost always for selfish reasons and I could never ask my partner to go through that because he'd hate it.  If your boyfriend wants to see other people, the chances are if you say no he could end up going behind your back anyway.   My advice would be to consider a break from the relationship over the summer. Tell him you love him and you don't want anyone else, but if he really wants to fool around with other people then you don't want to cheapen yourself and still be his girlfriend whilst he does. Then after the summer if you still want to be together you can be, as long as he stops seeing other people. It's incredibly selfish to impose an open relationship on someone who doesn't want one.

After that I left and said fuck it.  Since then it hasnt been the same between us.  Well girl 2. said I was no longer aloud to speak to girl 1. if I was to be friends with girl 2.

A little background:  I am a 21yr old male, my SO is a 23yr old female. We have been dating for under a year. I love her very much. We started dating in January and since then have spent A LOT of time together. I stayed over at her house almost every night, or at least the majority of the Spring semester. In the summer, we did the same thing I moved into a different house and she stayed over with me very frequently.   In the middle of the summer she left and to go back home (i was the only reason she stayed through spring because she graduated at the end of the fall). I was honestly heart broken and so was she.   During the course of this fall we have remained close, she visits frequently, a few times a month and stays with me, we talk every day, skype, text etc.   She starts school again (not the same school) next fall and I have one last semester here. I told her I want her back for the spring and she agreed.  I am moving out of a fraternity house into a single not very spacious apartment. We have both talked very seriously about her moving in with me. I would have no problem living with her, we have gotten in a couple fights before (mostly my fault) and resolved them. I enjoy her company very much. It makes sense financially because we would both live cheap and probably spend every day/night together anyways so if she lived elsewhere she would be paying for a place she would hardly stay in (and commute to my place).  The Dilemma:  It's a huge step for me being 21 years old and OFFICIALLY moving in with my girlfriend. Sure we spent basically every night together when we lived in the same city, but this is a little different. My friends know i'm crazy about this girl but i find it awkward to talk about among my friends. I don't wanna just make an announcement about it, but i also dont want to try and be secretive about it.   I feel like living officially with my girlfriend puts me in the position in all my friends eyes and even peers in general that I am VERY serious and that marriage and other crazy shit is on my mind.  I am scared to death i'm moving too fast because i am only 22. I have grown up fast and alot since dating this girl, and i dont hate it, it just scares me.

ceaklgn,1tpptt,nyokarose,"Hardest thing to accept in dating is there's no way to change what someone else wants. I am working on it slowly myself. If she's not ready, there's nothing you can do to make her more ready, and if she never comes round to being ready for you then she's just not right for you and you'll need to look for the girl of your realities instead.   That being said, here's my advice if you want to pursue her: As a lady, I find it a lot of really awkward, distance-creating pressure when a guy I have been friends with suddenly declares he has had feelings for me for a long time (not that it happens every Tuesday.) it's like he has his mind made up and I have yet to consider it. But I also appreciate guys who are straightforward; asking me to a movie as ""friends"" and then putting your arm on my shoulder is creepy if I am not interested.   My best experience was a guy who just simply said ""look, you're a good friend and I really enjoy spending time with you. I'd like to go on a few dates and see if anything more could be there between us, would you want to try it?"" It just felt like he took the pressure off me to decide right then, and that it wouldn't ruin the friendship if after a few dates I said it just wasn't there.   Anyway, that's my novel, I hope it can help you in some way. Best of luck mate.",relationshipadvice

465zuo,465zuo,Tacaconit,"Hi all. I bought a house with my ex husband in 2007--I am the primary borrower and he is the co-borrower. We separated in 2008 and our divorce was finalized in 2010. In the property settlement, I let him have the house with the stipulation that he refinance it in his name only. The exact phrasing is ""The parties agree that [Ex Husband], the Respondent, shall indemnify and hold [Me], the Petitioner, harmless from the [Bank] Home Mortgage Account debt. [Ex Husband], the Respondent, will refinance the following marital debt in his name only within a reasonable amount of time which is in relationship to the residence located at: [Property Address], with a legal description of: Second house on south side of North 3rd Street facing east in [City]. The parties have agreed that this real estate will not be sold and the Respondent will remain as the sole owner.""  I had originally written a specific deadline of within 18 months, but he would not sign the divorce papers with that specification. So it was changed to ""within a reasonable amount of time.""  Now it's 2016. He's had 6 years to do this and still has not done it because he claims his credit is too bad to refinance, which may be true. Several months ago I sent a certified letter telling him to refinance or legal action would be taken. He contacted me and said he tried, but could not get approved.  I am looking to buy a home, but being the primary borrower on this mortgage is affecting my ability to get a loan. I have good credit (in the 700's), but my debt to income ratio is too high.   I should add that he is making the mortgage payments and has not defaulted on any.  What can I do? 6 years is more than a reasonable amount of time.  Thank you.",legaladvice

7azwio,7azwio,RawPython,"Me, bf and our 2 year old needed to move from our current place (Polk County Florida) asap. We found another place very quickly from a Zillow ad. We seen the apartment, and proceeded to give these people $90 for an application fee. We were approved and we’re going to get the deposit the next day. The guy up and rented it out to someone else within 24 hours after knowing we were going to pay, but bf works odd hours that day.  Ok it’s fine , things happen I know.  He showed us another place he had available. He only has 3. We instantly hopped on that one. It was $200 more a month then the last apartment but we’d still be saving $200 a month on rent from our current place. We gave him the deposit that evening. We packed all our things up and turned the electric off at our current (now ex) home.  Now here’s the kicker...  We went the the apartment to move in late that night around 9. The realtor (or whoever this guy was) was working with us after hours to get that deposit. But once he got it he stopped responding. We told him the lockbox code wasn’t working. We were there trying that lock for over an hour when the neighbor above us drove up and asked if we were ok. We told him the situation and he went the the lock and PULLED THE WHOLE LOCKBOX OFF THE DOORKNOB. I looked at my mom who was there to help us move like “uh oh”.  Next day, we have the guy (realtor?) comes to try to open the door. He calls us and tells us (We ended up sleeping in the dark house we just moved out of btw) we can no longer move in cause we damaged the (cheap $10 doorknob) and we’re a liability. We told him it was the guy who lives directly above, gave him his name and all. Still said NO. So he gives us a check for our deposit and first month back. We realize it’s $50 short as we’re pulling off. He didn’t even tell us he was going to charge us for the doorknob! Bf gets out and is livid. Asks him why and he just sat there all smug and half chuckled.  We left and deposited the check into the bank. We looked up this guys credentials and he’s no where to be found. My dads a realtor and he looked up everywhere possible to see if this guys exists and HE does but no license or an address for the company does. Just a P.O. box.   The check he gave us was no good. Our bank said it bounced. We then put in a fraud claim and they gave us our money back.  We had to move in with my parents for a few weeks until we can find another place in a calmly manner.  I want this asshole to get his, some how some way. We grabbed his license plate but this is the second vehicle we've seen him in. He wont respond to any of our calls even if we call from odd numbers. Should we file a police report? The guy called our references and all so I feel like he's legit but again, my pop cant find anything professional on this guy except his linkedin profile. The website looks cheap and only has his number and po box. Yet it says 'appfolio' in the address bar and dad said that's legit.   What can we do?!  Update: Just filed a police report.

We've been having problems with communication for a while now. Namely..he's hypercritical and flies off the handle at the slightest provocation. I have no idea how to handle anger so I just bottle it up and keep my feelings to myself. Two months ago a coworker started flirting with me..unfortunately I reciprocated. We started texting back and forth, I told him I liked him. He kept pressuring me to leave my husband and I started thinking I would be better off without him. I told my husband that I wanted a divorce but I told my coworker that I was in a weird place and that if we were going to have a relationship it would be after I had separated from my husband. So the next day my coworker told my husband that I was coming on strong and exaggerated everything. Long story short my husband tells me he wants to work everything out and be with me. Like a fool I stay with him and quit my job, now he's worse than before. He calls me names, demands to see my text messages and makes snide remarks EVERYDAY.

c2l829s,kl8mk,karmasutur3,"&gt;We talk every night on chat and she said she liked me. I fell for her as soon as I saw her (I know, sad right?).  Not sad! Cool!  &gt;We haven't done anything for months though we've repeatedly planned to. I found out in late August that I was in the friend zone.   How did you find this out?  I'm assuming you are in HS?   &gt;It killed me on the inside to be seen as just a friend to someone I love so much  If you are under 18 or so years old, it's not love, just call it attraction. That's what it is.   That's beside the point. The lesson you need to take from this is that you have a limited amount of time to push the relationship forwards with most females.   This is because guys underestimate the emotional impact that the girls / women are feeling. They often have a really intense need to feel that their attraction is matched from your side. If you leave them wondering for too long, they will basically shut the feelings of attraction off because you are too much of a risk.   Do you understand? Example, she's just left your house, after making out a second time. You make plans with her, and that whole time, she's wondering things like  ""does he really like me? does he feel the same as me? am I really going to get him? what if he's just messing with me? or a liar? etc etc etc""  So when you aren't really worried about not hanging out for three weeks, cause it was hard to make plans, that whole time, she's paying attention to that, and every day seems to confirm her fears.   By the time you call, it's a bad situation, because that also seems to confirm her fears as well. ""Look, he waited till now to call and is just acting like it hasn't been three weeks. he's definately playing me .""   this is an awful, generalized example, but I hope you are understanding this. There's a million other ways to drive a woman away, but this is just one of them (and if you are zoned, it happens to be what went wrong).   &gt;Where do I go from here?  Well, in this case an Ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  But, it's much better to be rejected that friendzoned, so I would go ahead and give it another, much more aggressive shot.   Don't be a dick, but it's time to make her tell you no.  (not like stop, leave me alone, but your approach should be aggressive enough to where she understands loud and clear that you want to be with her. )   And if you feel so much for her, you may want to put her to a choice. Either she gives you a shot, or that's it, because you feel too much to just 'be friends'. Make sure she understands that loud and clear too.   Beyond that you don't have too many options, other than moving on.",relationshipadvice

The next day, we both went back to our parents house for the weekend and the next week she's distant and things aren't the same (she was at a conference all week but I could tell from the lack/short and forced text message and chats that something was up - she wouldn't say what) - that Friday she calls me over and asks to end it because she doesn't feel she's ready for a relationship.  I met her about 3 months after she moved to the area and she says she feels she hadn't settled in and needed her own space and chance to settle in. She also says she didn't feel she was being herself her (confirmed she said, by going home that weekend).

16puzc,16puzc,,"Background: I'm 18, I live in Dallas, Texas, and a couple months ago I was caught by the police for stealing beer from a convince store.  Last week I was in my friend Bob's car, in a park past curfew. It should be noted that we had a good amount of weed in the car. A cop pulled up behind us, ran up to the car door and demanded we show him our ID's. Another ticket on my record would get me into big trouble, so I did what any dumb-ass would do. I refused to show him my ID and instead took off into the night. I was promptly caught and arrested, and I spent the night in Jail.  A very unhappy father picked me up the next day, after dropping $3000 to bail out his idiotic, delinquent son.   I was charged with 2 counts of evading arrest, but nothing else. Obviously, if I would have stayed in the fucking car everything would be okay, but I did not.   I have chosen not to tell my lawyer/parents/anyone about the weed in the car. Is this smart?   Some hopefully helpful things to note-  -I had nothing illegal on me  -I was not read my rights when arrested. The first time I heard them was in front of the judge the next morning.  -The officer did not put my seat belt on while driving me to the police station. (Don't know if this helps, just thought I would mention it.)  The irony of the whole situation was that Bob wasn't charged with anything. The cop just gave him a warning for being in the park too late.   Any advice for me?

Simply saying ""man up, end it"" is quite easy when you're dating in high school and the most you have to put up with is seeing her in science class everyday, or when you're condescendingly typing at someone over the Internet. Things like this are not easy, it has nothing to do with ""manning up"", and if you stop and look around at the world you'll find very few things are a black and white but rather a shade of grey that you'd be wise to take note of before you jump in.

And sorry for any errors I’m frantically typing this on break at work.  &gt;  &gt;  Got myself into a situation. Last summer my fiancée graduated and I still had semester left of school. She was starting a job in Aug and I was going for my last semester. We had been talking about buying another car, and then the one we had gave out.  &gt;  &gt; So we bought a nice little used car that went through most of our savings. We also spent $1,400 on car repairs that didn’t fix the car. Then the dealership told us in October or November of 2017 that the car needed a part that was back ordered indefinitely, until at least sometime in 2018. On that day we bought ANOTHER car from this dealership, this time we financed one(horrible decision but not what this is about). I told the guy in service I planned to get the car in need of repairs fixed.  &gt;  &gt; Now granted, I am not without blame here because any sensible person would have checked up on it. But I did not. But in my mind I would be contacted when my part was available for order. Fast forward to about a month ago I got letter from DMV informing of lien. I think “Weird, you think they would of contacted me first before doing this”. So I finally speak to the guy today, and he tells me I owe $10,000 in storage fees.  &gt;  &gt; He also gives me three dates in Feb and May where he said he tried to call me and/or left voicemails. I have iPhone with visual voicemail and I don’t have voicemails from those dates and they go back to start of 2018. So he gives me three options.  &gt;  &gt; Settle for $2,500 by the end of this week.  &gt; Bring him the title, they salvage it. I’m responsible for rest of the bill.  &gt; The lien I assume would be the same thing. Eventually they own it. Get probably $1000 for it.  And I’m left with remainder.  &gt;  &gt; I don’t want them sending a $10,000 bill to collections. But also can’t pay $2,500. And I doubt they’d accept any flexibility because they won’t it off their lot.  &gt;  &gt; Anyone been in a situation similar, are they likely to send the remaining bill after Salvage to collections or cut their losses? &gt;  &gt; **Tl;dr** : is a dealership likely to pursue legal or collection method to obtain thousands of dollars in storage fees.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;      --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice

dwf9fcn,87s8l6,dtgal,"You can be fired for being written up multiple times. You can be fired for any reason as long as it is not discriminatory AND they provide appropriate notice. Being written up for telling customers the wrong thing, being late, not meeting sales, etc. are all valid reasons to discipline employees (even if they may lead to higher turnover).  The problem that I see with your wife's employer is it looks like they may be skirting disability protections under the human rights code. There is a difference between being disabled and being sick. The 10 emergency leave days are given to employees and once they are exhausted, employers do not have to provide more leave. However, if someone is absent from work because of a disability, then there could be a human rights violation.  So start [here] (http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability/2-what-disability) on what exactly a disability is - it can be interpreted quite broadly in Ontario (but it generally does not cover things that are everyday viruses like colds - a cold does not make you disabled).  The fact that someone cannot initiate a claim for accommodation without being at the work site poses numerous problems for the employer. On its face, it is discriminatory because someone who is disabled may not be able to get to the work site. That can be the case for both physical and mental disabilities. Also, an employee must inform their employer as soon as it is practically possible. If someone is in a car accident, the expectation is not that the first call is to their employer, but that call should be made in a reasonable amount of time based on the circumstances.  Since your wife had a respirator and was presumably told to stay at the hospital, I would say that it sounds like that would be something that would need to be accommodated. She should work with the HR department to come up with a return to work plan and any accommodations, if needed. For example, if she is cleared to work but needs a respirator, a reasonable accommodation may be required. The accommodation does not need to be her preferred accommodation, but one that can meet both her needs and her employers needs as well.",legaladvice

This is my first relationship, so I have no point of reference. I do know there is something very special that I've never had with anyone else. I know she loves me, but she has a lot of baggage.  She has been sharing, at my (gentle) request, the stories of her past, and always seems to halfway be expecting me to leave her, to be disgusted by something about her and not want to be involved with her anymore. I hope she's wrong. I know that her past is the past. She hates the things she has done, and sometimes herself for doing them. My disgust for some of the things she has done is strong. Too strong for me to ignore. And yet I believe I love her, and I know that none of her past issues change that.

qth92,qth92,dfbccff,"tl;dr: my cousin has started seeing a guy, my ex is also dating this guy (and has been for some time). What do I do?  I'm not sure if this is the right place for this as it's not a relationship that I'm in, but I couldn't think of anywhere else to post this...  When I was a lot younger I dated a girl,  we were friends for a few years beforehand, decided that we were right for one another and both fell in love. Everything went great for the best part of two years, but then University got in the way. We both moved to other sides of the country and decided that it would be fairer on both of us if we split up. This was an amicable decision, which we both accepted and decided to remain friends, and it works pretty well. We still keep in touch through texting and Facebook mainly, but we still go for a drink occasionally, watch a movie or break out my old N64 for a Mario Kart session.  Now for the past three and a bit years my she has been dating a guy on and off. It's quite a tempestuous relationship, they are either so in love, or wanting to kill each other!   Recently my cousin who is a few years younger than I am starting seeing a guy. They've been 'seeing' each other for about a month. I saw a picture of my cousin and her new man on her phone over the weekend and was shocked to see it was the same guy that is dating my ex girlfriend. Obviously I didn't tell my cousin, but I was taken aback.   Now I don't know what to do. Do I tell my ex (who is still a friend of mine), do I tell my cousin, do I leave it be, or do I completely go out of character and confront this guy?   I'm stuck as I don't want to cause any grief to anyone, but I don't want my cousin to fall for him.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.",relationshipadvice

How to fix this: Realize that she's both/either really messed up and/or incredibly spoiled.  **Messed up**: I don't know anyone who makes out with their gay best friend whom I'd still consider to be ""healthy"". This behavior indicates that she has zero self esteem and is desperate for approval. A guy kissing her -- *any* guy -- is translated to her into ""someone likes me enough to kiss me; I must have a good personality/be a good person/be really pretty/whatever she's looking for.""  Forget your anger; it's wasted. In response, you should pity her, because no matter how okay she seems on the outside, she's a boiling cauldron of self-hatred on the inside. Think about how much healthier a human being you are, and feel nothing but sorry for her and her inability to cope with herself. You'll quickly discover that pity is a powerful healing tool for you.  **Incredibly spoiled**: There's not a whole lot to this one. To do what she wants and then expect you to forgive her her transgressions indicates a very self-centered worldview. Problem is, she seems to get what she wants. According to you, she seems happy and adjusted, and she *still* gets to have sex with you and treat you like a crush/boyfriend, but on *her* terms and *her* time. You're doing nothing but feeding the beast.  First of all, knock it the fuck off. Stop sleeping with someone you clearly don't respect. You're not doing either of you any favors. In fact, you really shouldn't be communicating with her at all until you're over this.  Then realize that the world is going to *plow her into the ground* someday. Someone like this who's used to getting everything she wants is almost always guaranteed at least one hefty bitch-slap by reality at some point in their lives. From what I'm reading here, she's overdue. You need to let go of your anger by realizing that she's gone through childhood and adolescence and has entered adulthood without teaching herself any semblance of discipline and hard work. Her relationships will fail, her work will fall short, and people will be angry at her all her life, and once it catches up with her, she'll never know why.  **Bottom line**: You're angry because you think she's having so much better a time while obliviously persisting in being a much worse person. Once you come to recognize that you're a much healthier, better adjusted person than she is or is likely ever to be, and that you'll probably encounter far more success and happiness during the course of your life than she could even realistically hope for, you'll stop being angry at her.",relationshipadvice

dqkci,dqkci,laughingitoff,"I'm a 22-year-old, thin creative writing student at a university in a medium sized city and about a year ago I met Alice in a poetry class. She started talking to me and I got the feeling she was hitting on me but I was dating someone else and didn't really do anything. When that relationship didn't pan out, Alice continued to text me for several months and we'd see each other infrequently. She's a sorority-turned-hippie type of girl so I had it in my head for too long that she was ""too pretty"" for me or some bullshit. Eventually I got over this and started working up the nerve to act on what I perceived to be flirtatious advances. She's receptive to my humor, she touches my arms and hands, she's winked at me across rooms and one night even jokingly told me she'd fuck me if I picked her up. So I was pretty sure she was hitting on me, but I wasn't going to do anything because I didn't want to embarrass myself if I was wrong. To complicate matters I have spent some time talking to her to help get over my ex-girlfriend, so she's seen some amount of weakness on my part. We talk to each other about people we're dating, too which I understand is symptomatic of the ""friend zone."" Over time I realized I really was having fun with her when we hung out 1-on-1, and I feel like I can really be myself with her. We have lots of stimulating conversations and shared interests. Eventually I decided to go for it when she made some comment about wanting a boyfriend.  We were supposed to go on a community bike ride that meets weekly here in the city but we got there too late and everyone had left. We kind of biked around at my insistence and eventually I said ""Hey, let's go get dinner,"" and I offered to buy. I put my arm around her and we had a good dinner, we had lots to talk about and I'm sure she had a good time. Afterword I didn't really try to touch her... she said she had to leave but I reminded her of a book I wanted to lend her and she came to my house, I lent her the book, and walked her outside. I was trying to push myself to go for a kiss but I couldn't do it. I didn't think the chemistry was there exactly, not yet maybe, so instead we kind of awkwardly half-hugged and said goodnight.  What the fuck do I do now? I don't think it's going to be awkward seeing her again or anything, but I'm not sure if I should ask for a second date or not. I don't think she was weirded out by me, and I'm pretty sure she enjoyed herself, but I don't know if she's receptive to this at all. She must have realized how flirtatious she was being, but I'm worried I'm missing something. She knows like ten million people in school because she used to be a sorority chick, and lots of obnoxious bro types of guys always seem to hit on her.

And whose pipe is it--the neighbor's, or the water utility's? Was your neighbor or the water company paying for those repairs and re-landscaping?   Check your deed paperwork and your title search paperwork. Is there an easement showing the pipe, and the terms/conditions of access/digging/landscaping?   If Yes, then that easement language will guide your lawsuit against him for restoring your lawn and hedges, but the pipe will likely remain on your land.

I want to respond from two angles, one as now someone who works in the mental health field, and as someone who has received treatment for depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts.  I currently work with people who have serious mental illness (usually bipolar, schizophrenia, co-morbidity with substance abuse) in a supportive living situation (normal apartments, but with supportive staff always on site). Our members make suicidal threats often, have threatened staff's safety, and can generally be in an unstable place. We rarely forcefully hospitalize someone. And I really do mean rarely. When it does happen, it is something we do not take lightly and do not feel good about. There is a lot of legal paperwork to fill out, and it's painful for everyone involved. We do everything possible to avoid it.   As a recipient of mental health services and someone who attempted suicide, I will say that, while your fear of involuntary hospitalization is legitimate, it is not something that would likely happen. I have talked openly with therapists about suicidal thoughts and plans. They never suggested or threatened hospitalization.   If you do seek treatment, and I really hope you do, I suggest seeing a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). Respecting patient autonomy is a cornerstone of their training. I find social workers in my personal and professional experience to be more open-minded and flexible. Psychologists sometimes can have a rigid view of mental illness and are less respectful of a patient's wishes. (This is not a rule, of course, and their are many great psychologists.)   Lastly: Even though I am often suicidal and struggle daily with depression, I am consistently thankful my attempt was not successful. It is worth sticking around. With time and support, you absolutely can move past the all-encompassing power depression can have.  Suicide hotline: 1-800-273-8255 Crisis text line: text ""home"" to 741741",legaladvice

We always talked of our future ( young i know) but over the last two weeks we had our first arguement, and followed quickly by a drama.  I went on his facebook messages to look at what hus relationship was like with a girl he constantly talked to. Yes i know, i broke the trust. Im a horrible girlfriend, i know. Turned out he had asked this girl out and she said no. I asked him if he had, he looked me in the eyes and promised on our relationship he didnt. I told him i read it. He then confessed up. Throughout that week our relationship was rocky. I asked him if he wanted a break or break up and he said i dont know. I initiated a break. He vsme back apologising the next day. I took hin back. Fast forward a week of real struggle for me, to build up trust. I started talking to a guy friend about it and he was helpful ( no attraction at all there btw). Anyway, i trusted him enough to get intimate again.   Last night we went to a party, which i was unsure about because it was all his friends i didnt know, and the girl was coming. We end up sitting around together and i tried to make coversation where i could. She was actually pretty cool and so was her sister. I especially enjoyed going out with him because we hardly do.   Now last night, i went on his facebook again. Strike 2 against me, i know. But, this time it was because i was worried he was going to do something and get hurt. Anyway, i found he was talking to the girl after saying goodnight to me. I didnt really care, and found it happy that at least she was helping him to do what could've been bad in a safer way. But then, I saw that he had been complaining to her about how boring i am and how he has to babysit me. he said when he was out with me, he saw and thought how much funner it would be to be with other girls. he acted like i had been holding him back from having fun.And, he organized to go out with her (friends i think) next weekend. He said that, he wanted to see if he could have fun with other girls, and if he could, he would break up with me.  My trust is broken. I dont know what to do. I dont want to break up with him, but at the same time hes being saying all this stuff to this girl, which hasnt been apparent at all to me.. and yes, its apparent i have trust issues myself due to invading his privacy like that. I know.   I love him. I thought we were fine. I thought we were fixed. What do i do?",relationshipadvice

1hslvt,1hslvt,Cypher_Diaz,"Reddit, I have no idea what I'm doing. Help? Here's the situation: I've had this friend since middle school. We hung out all the time and then we broke apart after she went to high school. My feelings for her were still there, they were just thrown on the back burner for a while. She got into a relationship where they were serious for 3 years. She would talk to me about how she was miserable and he would threaten self abuse if she ever left.  We reconnected after I went to college and we started to hang out more. Going to the movies, I invited her out to a get-together my fraternity was hosting, and one day when she was over and I was fixing a computer problem, I kissed her. It took her by surprise, and we fumbled through the next couple of minutes and I did it again, when I pulled away, she kissed me! I was dumb founded. A slew of questions I wanted to ask bubbled from my adrenaline doped mind. I just couldn't speak them. My tongue was just fat and foreign in my mouth. Words were impossible. She blushed and then ran off and it was a week to where we would talk again. I asked her if she would like to start dating, but take it super slow because of what she got out of. She replied with only a statement that reminded me of us in our youth. ""I just wanna go explorin""a phrase that broke my heart and yet I didn't give up hope. She talks about all the dates she's had, the party nights she's slurred through, and conquests she's had.  Fast forward a month because of a summer job, and  I get in touch with her to see if she wanted to go to a social gathering with my brothers. She said yes! So 30 minutes later she pulls up, gets to know everyone and I'm quite inebriated, and she's sober and offers to drive me home. I stayed the night on her floor and she refuses to talk about the kiss, and all she'll say is. ""It's not that you're not attractive, it's just I don't wanna talk about it.""   What am I to do?

Regardless of how the offense is classified in the region where the person was convicted, if it is considered to be a summary offense in Canada, inadmissibility will not be an issue.

1t9nt7,1t9nt7,Copenhang,"Ladies, is it common for you to just completely stop having friends as soon as you get in a somewhat serious relationship?  I have noticed that, at least in my last few relationships, the longer I date a girl, the less time she spends with her friends.  It eventually gets to the point that I am now the only person my girlfriend spends time with.  (This was true as well for my last serious relationship)  If she isn't spending time with me then she is sitting around at home by herself and texting me how much she misses me and generally making feel bad for not being with her.  I tell her to hang out with her friends and she says that she doesn't have any. I have tried to get her to become friends with my friends so that she doesn't feel left out or so my friends don't feel left out but that is rare when it happens because she doesn't want to hang out with them, she just wants it to be us.   I know I didn't do anything to push her away from her friends, it just seems that she just doesn't want to see her friends or do anything if I'm not with her, again this was true for past relationships as well.  So my question is, is this a common occurrence when women get in relationships or is there anything I can do about it?  I love my girlfriend but I hate being made to feel bad just because I want to hang out with my friends every now and then.    Also a side note is that it isn't like my girlfriend and I don't see each other much, we stay together every other night just about if not more.  tl;dr Why do girls seem to alienate their friends when they get in a serious relationship?  *I am aware that not all women are like that, just going on my past relationships and what I have seen from friends.",relationshipadvice

A quick update here, if you do read this I'd greatly appreciate a response....since this post we have kept spending a LOT of time together.  Things were going really great when suddenly I noticed her withdrawing a bit from me.     We've talked at great length about it and basically this is what she has said:  1. she thinks I'm too good for her  2. her previous relationship left her so emotionally damaged that at times she feels ""empty"" and just cold overall...though roughly 3 weeks after we started seeing each other she did say that I had been helping change that.  Still though it is an issue.  3. related to #2 she says for the past two months or so she's been feeling very scatterbrains, unable to focus like she used to, falling behind on her college courses, is no longer organized like she used to be and it all makes her feel very frustrated.  Almost like a loss of identity.  It's evident that she's going through somewhat of a depressive stage....and I attribute it all to how her ex treated her...a real class-A asshole (abuse, verbal and physical).  It's like she subconsciously believes all the things he'd tell her.  In any case, she says she can't imagine not seeing or talking to me at all..but asked that we not spend as much time together while she works things out and fixes herself.  Besides making it clear to her that I'll wait and help her get through this however I can, I'm at a loss of what to do or make of this.  To be honest, it does not sound like that ridiculous of a request to me...I mean how healthy is it to jump into one relationship right after getting out of one...so from that perspective, I do think she needs time to herself.  She's assured me that I'm not a rebound; and I believe her...for some reason I just feel like I know for a fact this isn't an excuse so she can see other people.  It goes without saying that I've kept falling hard for her...and well I know she has very strong feelings for me too...but she's not making this up.  I've seen her condition gradually worsen and I can see it tearing her apart.  I want to believe that she will be able to fix matters and then resume our relationship where we left off...but the pessimistic side of me keeps telling me otherwise.

c2ltua9,kng55,karmasutur3,"&gt;Note: I do not want to be the rebound. While I don't have a girlfriend, and sex after a 1+ year dry spell would be awesome, I've read enough and seen enough movies to know that would be a bad idea right now. A FWB arrangement seems exceedingly unlikely to come out of this; that's just not something she'd do in any right state of mind.  Ok first off, what you see in movies should be CATEGORICALLY FORGOTTEN forever.   It may be a great idea. It may be a terrible idea. Your mileage may vary.  But one thing is fairly clear:  If you don't want to get friendzoned, you either have to deny her the emotional support of your friendship altogether through this process(of her breakup), or you have to make strong moves and get hooked up quick.   Something worth mentioning: My mother and father got together via her 'rebounding', and they are still together.   Something else: I've done it before, and had it gone super , super bad.   More things: If you do choose to go for it, you have to be aggressive, but you can't go right in. You're going to have to let her queue you, and let you know when it's correct. Look for the signs. But if you are given signs and fail to act, you're going to get super zoned.   But this:   &gt;she wants me to sleep over  Is a HUGE indicator of wants to be more than friends.  If you choose to do that, you need to go for it, carefully and tactfully.  Again , if you don't, you are just another beta male giving away your valuable emotional support for nothing, and that makes you desperate and soft in ways that you don't want to be soft.",relationshipadvice

However, that gets into a very blurry issue in law: the difference between witness preparation and coaching. The upshot for you is that while giving testimony **you should never, ever lie.** If what I described is a true account of why you did what you did, then that's a good way to put it. If it isn't, then you should stick to a true account. Not even considering the ethics or legalities of it, the second a jury or judge even suspects you're giving a less than truthful accounting of the facts, ALL of your credibility instantly goes out the window. And the odds of them catching on are pretty darn good, so be honest! Credibility is currency in legal trials.  When considering my comments, though, do bear in mind that this isn't really my field, so it's best if you follow the advice of people who really do know their stuff in the arena of traffic and insurance coverage law.   /u/Shearer9, for example, is [making a lot of sense on the insurance front.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3d5txi/pulled_out_right_in_front_of_a_speeding_car_to/ct2bzwo) I agree with her or him that your insurance company probably should be defending you here, even if they reserve the right not to cover you, and although I'd suggest a softer approach when at least initially bringing this up with your insurer, you should definitely chat with Shearer about the ins and outs of that area of law.  It's unfortunate, but this subreddit is a slightly treacherous place in terms of getting quality advice. It's not exactly uncommon to see people (a few of whom may even be attorneys) either not reading carefully or shooting their mouths off on things they're not really qualified to talk about. I just try to be up front about what I don't really know offhand, like insurance coverage law, for example. I probably make mistakes here too just because I'm not doing the ton of research I'd normally do before telling an actual client anything, but I do my best to stick to things I can actually make a positive contribution on.  Anyway, definitely look into legal aid, because I wouldn't suggest taking your shot on this incident alone and you've got a really compelling story, and talk to Shearer about the insurance issue.

I called her the next day and we planned breakfast for the day after that. Met up, ate, talked a while, then ended up walking around the nearby university campus for a while just talking.

I don't have a problem with that, but given that we're just getting to know each other, it makes it hard to tell.

Either way, she has, minimum, two years left to go before she can even think about returning to you. Two years is an absurdly long time to expect either of you to be perfectly happy without daily or even weekly physical interaction. And there's far more to ""physical interaction"" than sex. Something as simple as eye contact or a hand-hold with your significant other can sometimes mean the world.  There's a reason Reddit tells young lovers that long-distance relationships don't work: as a rule, they don't. You're both just barely adults. You've had your hormones for less than a decade. You can count on one hand the number of years you've been old enough to try a real relationship. To be 19/21 and off to college a hundred miles apart and attached to someone you can't see whenever you want to is far too big a burden for either of you to bear.  Look, I'm 27. I'm not exactly an old fogie. But I know that a long-distance relationship like this wouldn't work for me, either; like you, I'm too young, and there are too many possibilities out there to tie myself to someone I can't actually be with, no matter how much I might love that person. You've just got to believe people when they tell you that 19/21 is too young to be convinced that you've found the person you'll spend the rest of your life with, *especially if you're not with the person for two to four years*. Remember that there are literally billions of other people out there. The chances that you've found ""the one"" at 21 are almost nonexistent.  I hate being the bearer of bad news -- I really do -- but sooner or later, your relationship *will* come to an end. All I can tell you is to enjoy it while there's still something in it to enjoy.

DON'T DO IT! It sucks that you planned your future with her in mind, but you are young and need to move on....without her.  Beyond that, I think these items from a break-up list also geared toward women would apply to men, too.  * Cut off all communication with your ex. * Realize that just because this relationship is over, it doesn't mean that you'll never find love again. * Cry on your best friends' shoulders - this is what they are there for. *I know guys aren't typically as into crying as girls, so translate this as you see fit* * In retrospect, you will probably only remember what you love about your ex, and your happiest memories together. * Use your breakup as an impetus to become the person you have always wanted to be. * Do not hook up with your ex. * Resist the urge to have a rebound.  * Buy a break-up book (just one) that won't look too pathetic on your bookshelf. (We highly suggest How to Get Over a Break Up by the Break Up Guru herself!) * Do anything you can to make yourself feel sexy and desirable. *guys can do this too!* * Endure the pain and loneliness bravely...with time, the pain will subside although you sure as heck don't believe that right now. * Try to avoid friends who are very close with your ex, or common friends, they are bound to talk about them and bring you down inadvertently. *you don't have to alienate them, just don't spend every day hanging out with the group of mutual friends you may have had with her*",relationshipadvice

I've been dating my current girlfriend for about 6 months now, she's very awesome and we get along great. But about 7 months ago my best friend of 9 years(who is a girl and has a boyfriend) told me that she is in love with me and wants to be together when we are single. Now I've been in love with my friend for about 4 years now. I told her when I started getting feelings but we decided not to act on it and just remain friends. We stopped talking for about a year after that. We started talking again and it was like we never stopped. We now talk on the phone almost daily.

5wjni5,5wjni5,squidy00,"Hello,  I'm in Canada and am renting out a condo I own. The tenant turned on the kitchen sink one day and the pipe immediately burst, I do not know exactly where on the pipe but it seemed as though it was fixed without going into the wall.  I called my insurance company and they advised that pipes were likely a common element and the responsibility of the condo corp to maintain and repair.  So I looked into my condo declaration and found this the definition of the boundaries of my unit. In there it said:    ""Not withstanding the foregoing, the unit does not include:  - Any pipes, wires, cables, conduits, plumbing, sewers or other service facility located within the unit boundaries and which service any other unit or units  In the vicinity of enclosures for pipes, wires, cables, conduits, plumbing sewers or other service facility located within the unit, the boundary shall be the backside face of the drywall forming such enclosures""    My thought would be the pipes servicing my sink would not be part of my unit as they service many other unit and just branch onto each units' sink.

Since then we have been chatting daily on facebook and I met up with her after work one night and I felt there was chemistry between us. We talk into the late hours of the night and I have never known anybody to have so much in common as me, it's getting to the stage where it's a bit scary she is so alike me.  She has recently just had a bad breakup and he basically told her she has no spark in her life and is a bit dull, she has very little self confidence as it is, but I think the world of her and she knows it. She tells me stuff that she has never told a living soul before and vice versa. We plan on going on Holiday together alone next summer. I did ask her out but she said it was too soon after her break up which is fair enough, but I asked was this the only reason or was she sparing my feelings and she said it was a bit of both. I feel there is something there but I have been in similar positions before and totally cocked it up.  Is she interested/will ever be interested in me? She is extremely she in person and goes back to uni very soon so I havn't got too much time to actually meet her in person again. Am I just a shoulder to rant on after the breakup?

I don't know how mature she is, and how open you are in your relationship - but I know I didn't learn until later (after 5 years) to tell my partner that I was bored, felt alone or unappreciated. Maybe she feels this, but doesn't realize it and Steve brings some of it into her life. Going out late at night, new people etc makes her feel better.

Make sure you have plans of your own and that you're living *your* life as well. This will make you more interesting to her as well. It is important for yourself as well, that you life your life.  - As you realized yourself, the texting part wasn't so smart. Instead, have an honest and open talk with her about this. You need to first define exactly what it is that is a problem for you. Do this in a constructive way, by not accusing her but rather explain how you feel when something happens (e.g. she's hanging out with Steve). Explain that it is important for you that you can have ""relationship time"" together.  - You're demanding things from her, instead of explaining what is happening inside you. She can't know that.

o9b50,o9b50,ScarletJedi,"My dear Reddit friends,  I have been friendzoned in the past. I was plagued by it too. I have successfully overcome it with 2 girls, and haven't been friendzoned in over three years.   Warning: Pure evil straight ahead. (To any women: you created this)  By the way, this is a dangerous and ugly road to embark on. This isn't how you meet your soulmate. This is how to get a girl for a night or a few months at best. When a girl puts you in the friendzone and you escape this way, if you ever revert back to your old self, you'll go right back to the friend zone.  Any one worth having a relationship will like you for being yourself. This is how you win the battle but lose the war.    **Consider women as lesser beings**   Yes. It's not easy if you have a shred of humanity. But if you can convince yourself that all girls are stupid pieces of meat, they will want you. Don't be overtly mean. But just NEVER EVER say anything nice. When girl fishes for compliments, hit her off with something insulting.Think I'm wrong, Ladies and Gents, how many girls do you know have been with guys that treat women the way I described?  Stupid whore: Oh my god I got an A on this final!!  Texting: Cool In person: That's surprising, (act like you're shocked she can even read) **Be a dick**  If you believe the girl is a piece of crap and doesn't deserve your time, treat her as such. 1-2 word messages MAX. Be a dick. She texts you complaining about her current boyfriend or guy she likes? Respond: too bad, or your fault.  When she flips out, go play skyrim and ignore her for the next few days. See her in person? Take out your phone and start reading ESPN, playing angry birds or whatever you enjoy mid conversation  Call girls fat. If she's anorexic or has a disease, don't do it. Otherwise, go for it. Yes this might be pure evil. You might say I refuse to become that kind of guy. Guess what? Those are the guys that get the girl. Make some subtle jokes like: were those pants always that tight?, you want a drink, maybe a diet soda? How's that new year's resolution to lose weight coming along?   **Never say anything nice**   They don't deserve it and most women see compliments as a sign of weakness. If a girl does you a favor. Do not say thank you unless provoked. This girl once gave me a ride somewhere in the rain. As I got out I told her she could do whatever she wanted, I wouldn't need a ride later and shut the door. She texted me, Not even a thank you?!!! . I never responded.    **No thoughtful presents, ever. **  I make it a point to not bring gifts to birthdays graduations etc. Oh it's your birthday? I'm here, that should be enough.   **Don't talk about other guys/girls**   You might think you're making her jealous, but all you're doing is opening up the opportunity for her to talk about other guys. That's the ultimate friendzone conversation. Making her jealous is important but it has to be done the right way.   **Make her jealous**  Let's say you have plans for Friday night. You and your boys are going out to dinner. Call her and ask her to hang out. 15 minutes before you're supposed to hang out, cancel. Don't give an excuse, just say, tonight's not going to work out. That's it don't respond to any more texts. Don't say sorry. Just that.   You like the friend so much you want to use another girl to make her jealous? Easy enough. Don't complain to her about the new girl. Don't ask her for advice about the new girl. Just ignore the Friend, and when she asks you where you've been, just say hanging out with XXXX. That's it. She tries to prod more, just say ""eh""shrug your shoulders etc. If she says you're being weird or some nonsense, just say, ""I just like to keep my relationships private"".   **Leave her hanging**   In my experience, a friend zoned male will constantly be asked to rescue the girl. Let's say you get the text: I got a flat tire, what do I do? Don't respond. Just let her suffer.   After doing this for a long time, start using  positive reinforcement. When she flirts with you, be nice to her. She doesn't, be distant. Do this for a while, then stop being responsive to nice things. She will eventually start doing nicer and nicer things to get your attention.   tl;dr be mean to girls and they will like you",relationshipadvice

Somehow, the moving company lost my entire bed, which consisted of a wooden headboard, footboard, and siderails. It was purchased in the 1970s by my great great grandmother and had been in use since then, which speaks to the quality of it. It wasn't a super-elegant mahogany set, but it was still sturdy after 50 years.  I filed a claim for $550 immediately after not receiving it. The moving company told me they could give me $300 no questions asked, or they could have an outside restoration firm do what seemed like an investigation if I wanted more than $300. I opted for them to get the outside firm involved and cooperated fully.   Fast forward a few months to Monday. The restoration firm shows up to my apartment and says there's nothing they can do since the bed is completely lost (duh).   Today I received an email from the moving company stating they were authorizing a check for exactly half of what I claimed ($275.00), since they don't have proof of the value of the bed. It was purchased in the 1970s, of course I don't have proof of the value. This won't cover the cost of buying a new bed of similar quality.  What are my options?  Thanks in advance. UKH",legaladvice

5f0gj9,5f0gj9,,"Hello, here is the story.   My wife was driving on highway in a left lane at night behind a sedan when a pickup truck in front of that sedan dropped a dresser on the road. Sedan went thru the dresser and so did my wife. Nobody stopped, wife drove home. After seeing the damages next day (bent radiator and evaporator, broken fans, cosmetic) we called geico and they sent an adjuster, who quoted 1.9k in repairs. We asked geico to tow the car to vw dealer.  Dealer quoted ~6k in repairs and pretty much recommended to total the car (2011 jetta, 112k mi, worth ~4-5k, we owe ~5.5k to the bank). That was not an option because we cannot afford to buy or lease another car right now, and geico refused to total it.  So geico adjuster offered geico approved shop and the car was towed there. Wife called the shop right away and told them not to touch the car until we see estimate from the shop. Shop agreed. Fast forward 2 weeks, during which she called the shop multiple times asking for estimate and making sure that nobody works on the car, she gets estimate for 2.8k via email. Going thru estimate, there is bunch of unnecessary stuff (plastic decor, repaint etc) plus overpriced parts. What actually needs to be done is roughly 1.4k with parts and labor.  Ok so we go to the shop next day to discuss. Same geico adjuster is there. Started talking to them about estimate, and low and behold they tell us that the car is already fixed. Asking why did they do anything without permission from us, they give us lame excuses like they only have 2 weeks to fix the car, telling me that the first geico estimate for 1.9k is the shop estimate and they just found more damage and so on.  So to sum it up, we have never seen _shop_ estimate before repairs and never gave the shop an authorization to repair the car.  The only signature they have is the one on the credit card receipt for insurance deductible when my wife picked up the car.  I am baffled, this is a staple example of Miami, Florida car business. Shady as hell.  Do I have any say in this now? It looks to me they broke couple Florida statutes. What can I do?",legaladvice

c8vwwe6,1ablun,I_eat_cheeto_4_lunch,"This may be the end of your honeymoon period in your relationship. When a relationship is new and fresh everything is awesome. Every second seems to spawn endless joy and it's impossible for you to see any imperfections in each other. However, when this period draws to a close, the real relationship starts. What I mean is the two of you will now begin to notice flaws in each other and question the quality, success rate, trust, etc of the relationship. The honeymoon period may have ended earlier for her and she's just reassessing the situation. It's like a midterm report, performance evaluation, or report card of a relationship.   She may be projecting insecurities onto you and it's your job to reassure her. How do you do that? COMMUNICATION. If you don't talk to each other a relationship will fail. Just ask her how she feels about the relationship and where she would like the relationship to go. I'm talking realistically here. If she says married for 50 years and never argue then just ask her where she sees this relationship in a month, 6 months, or a year. See what she expects out of you and you let her know what you expect. This way the two of you can be honest and work on existing problems and build a healthy relationship. Plus she may have been cheated on in the past and is trying to protect herself. Give her reassurance and let her know you care about her and would never do something like that.",relationshipadvice

We have been together for a year and a bit, moved in together after about a month.   It's hard to condense all of the emotions into one post without making it an epic one, but i'll try.  She is 9 years younger than me and this is the first time she has lived away from home, Im 29 and have lived away from home for 10 years, so I am used to running a household etc. Were currently in a tiny flat in my dad's house, and she moved with me, leaving her friends and family to follow me, but the flat is so small, we are in each other's pockets all of the time.  Basically, I feel too much like I am having to teach her all about the world, and a household, and don't get me wrong, she really has been trying. But I find myself moaning about tidying up etc etc. (which I hate myself for)  So.... I suggested we split, and like I say, she is coming tonight to take all of her stuff back to her parents. But I feel awful about it, Im going to miss her so much, when were not couped up in the flat, everything is fine, but I don't know when we will be able to move out, it may be a year and what shall we do in the meantime?  Really I just want some advice, does the fact that Im going to miss her being around mean that Im making the wrong decision?   I once had a kitten and it was such a pain, I tried to take it back, but in time the kitten grew up and now I wouldn't be without her, am I risking doing the same with my girlfriend? just sending her away?

We flirted a lot for a few days after that, but then she just abruptly stopped talking to me all together. I asked her if she still liked me', and she said more as a friend. Which devistated me, and i moped around for a couple of weeks, but got happier, though I never really got over her. Over time, she had waves of liking me' and not liking me, which just messed with my emotions a lot. And recently, i found out she has a boyfriend now. She's changed a lot since she moved here, but i still know that we'd be a perfect couple if she only had feelings for me'. And yesterday I overheard a friend of hers and her talking about how obsessed i am with her. I don't know what to do. I've tried for months before to move on but I just can't.

ce2axth,1sxi5f,KarliahNightingale,"The common theme in your message was this: ""my boyfriend is investing time, money, effort, and himself into things other than me.""  Now whether he loves you or not is in question here. I don't want you to think I'm implying he doesn't care about you or doesn't want to be with you. It's pretty obvious that he's not as serious as you are regarding the relationship and he isn't as emotionally invested into you as you are to him.   Asking a girlfriend to invest in a house that ""he wants to build regardless if he's with you or not"" is the most obvious example of this. If he was at the same place in the relationship emotionally as you are then this wouldn't even be an issue. He would want to start a life with you, even if that meant the small step of getting an apartment together. He would want you to feel comfortable and happy with your living arrangements. He would choose your happiness over business investments and owning nice things.   I think you need to take a few steps back internally and re-evaluate the relationship. If I were you, I would also get my own apartment regardless of his choices. I mean, it seems like he's making decisions regarding his life with you as an after thought, so you need to so the same (to a certain extent).

I looked up online and it said that it was illegal to tow my car if I am in possession of it and inside of the vehicle with it turned on. So I got in my car and turned it on and waited while my friends worked things out with the tow men who started becoming very mean and snappy. One of the men then called the cops on us saying that he felt threatened. The cops arrived and we explained the situation then they just stated it isn’t their call and that they won’t do anything as well as told us to let them tow our cars.

dusa3lp,7zxd3g,nervous_sister,"Hi, thanks very much for your response.  As far as I've witnessed, and from what he's said, my brother hasn't done any kind of drugs since the arrest. It's been hard for him, especially being surrounded by it in his work environment (music festivals) but he knows it's important and has taken 2 drug tests so far to keep a record and show he's been clean.   I agree he should make an effort to do in-person NA and I'll bring this up with him again. It's hard because he's moving around a lot and has such long hours with work, but maybe he can go between his contracted work gigs if he has a few free days. If he goes to an NA meeting I'll tell him about keeping a file of the sheets as well, thanks for the heads up.  I didn't know about the drug and alcohol assessment...so that's like a self-report? I'll tell him he should maintain that this was the first time he ever bought drugs, he bought them legally, but I guess admit he was transporting them illegally (by crossing the state line). Also he can say that he doesn't drink. That's a good idea and I hadn't realized this report was part of the process. I had been thinking he should say he used marijuana to address his mental health issues but he could just say it was the first time he ever bought it and he was planning to try it for his mental health issues.

She is a Biochemistry major and I am an MBA student, two totally different worlds.  We both work in admissions and see each other rarely. The only time we really ""hang"" is when we are working an open house and giving tours and going to meetings after. When we see each other during these days, which are rare, we usually hang out, like i said. We talk about whatever pops into our head, usually about how the event is going. Today we had an event like this and we talked more than ever. We talked about the event, which lead to talking about piercings and tattoos. She showed me her 2 tattoos and they were actually very thought out. I noticed that she changed her hair style and mentioned that I liked it a lot, true story, she looked amazing (trying not to be creepy in this post). Her reaction was very positive and thanked me for noticing.  While I was roaming around doing my duties, she told me she had to do the same thing (make sure there were no empty seats in the 3000 person seating arrangement). I found her to always come back to where I am standing and just stand there with me, there are a few of us ""oddballs"" in the organization so she may just want to fit in. At the end of the day she told me that she was going to sing later and we talked about how tired we were after the busy day. I asked her if she could sneak a quick nap in before she had to sing, and she told me she could, and so on and so forth. She then rushes out of the door after we hand in our documents for the day, I do as well, but I am about 10 paces behind her.  She slowed down because she noticed I was behind her. We then talked about the ""mysterious tunnel"" underneath the school and whatnot on the way to our cars. When we reached the parking lot after talking about other various things we parted ways and I wished her good luck on her singing later that night.

l8p9x,l8p9x,zakool21,"This is more for me to vent and to express my feelings than anything, but I thought maybe I'd offer it for peoples' advice, too.   I'm a 25 year old guy. I met a gal last year when I was living in Korea. She's 32 and from China, doing her PhD in Korea. Very smart, can't say a single bad thing about her. I love her a lot. I didn't see her for 6 months between when I left Korea and when she came to visit the US for the first time in August. We had a great time. The sex has always been amazing and the chemistry has always been there.   I moved to France recently and have been completely absorbed by the experience. By far not my first time in France, but definitely my first time trying to manage a long-distance relationship while being here. I really haven't been into it a lot. I've *always* found it hard to long for someone when I'm so far away and I know I can't see them. The question I ask myself is: is this just the way I am or is it because I haven't found the right person yet?  She always told me that if I was seeing someone else than to just tell her. Today I was talking to her on the phone and mentioned that there's a girl I know here who may be interested in dating me. I'm also interested in dating this gal. Gal in Korea says go for it, you need to experience other people, but that we can't do this long distance thing any more.   She said that she had been thinking about it a lot lately. The thing is, she's never one to really bring up an issue on her own. This is not a surprise to me since she, like other Asian women I've dated, she is very ready to placate a situation and keep the status quo. It's a human characteristic, overall. I had hesitations about addressing it, but I felt it better to address it now than to wait till later down the road, or worse, cheat on her.   The thing is, when we're together, things are wonderful. The only problem I can perceive is that of age and vast differences in goals and background. She's 7 years older than I am, and on a good career path. I am a traveler by nature (she hadn't been out of Korea/China until she was 31) and far more adventurous.   I think maybe I was looking for a way out but didn't know how to express it. One friend of mine was just shocked that I could "" break it off like it's an old ipod."" In reality, we had a really good, level-headed discussion about it. I'm still maybe a little in shock about it but at the same time it was hard to get emotional in the other direction (of sadness and longing) with her so far away and out of my life.   You've heard the phrase, ""If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it's yours."" I don't know whether this applies here or not. We never put future involvement out of the question, though.  It seems logically like the right thing to do since long-distance relationships aren't practical.

I met this guy at a bar (in a college town, we're both students), we talked, and when he left he invited me to a party at his house the next night.

Sorry for being long-winded, but that's the last I heard from him and I want some other opinions. Obviously it seems like he's just not interested, and I can accept that. But also, because I did a lot of the initiating, I think he is not used to really pursuing girls, and I thought this might not be as black and white as interested/not interested. (I have mutual friends with him, and they say that he is bad with girls, is timid and not totally confident, and has a hard time making a move, etc.)      Is there a chance that he is just bad at reading signals and he might be worth pursuing some more, or is this a case of clear lack of interest?

But I get the feeling it is just something he wrote on his own and left for you to find.  If the family has the phone, and the music files are on said phone, then the family has his music. His wishes have been carried out, in that regard.   I understand it's sad that you won't have the photos and the music for yourself, but with the effort the family has made to exclude you, it sounds like they harbor feelings of resentment towards you. They are still probably quite understandably upset about the suicide. I think it would be more reasonable to allow much more time to pass, say maybe even a year, and then try reaching out to them politely and asking if they can share the music data, once fresh wounds have healed.

s8bb8,s8bb8,andre_bass,"*tl;dr at the bottom.*  Hey everyone, on Wednesday this week I ended my year and half relationship with my girlfriend (I just turned 23, she's 19).  It's a very one sided matter, I just haven't been feeling it for a few months and kind of had an epiphany.  During the actual breakup (which didn't last more than fifteen minutes before she locked herself in the bathroom), I kept my cool the entire time, and tried to explain my reasoning as clearly as I could.  I was dumped out of nowhere once in a previous relationship, so I know the hurt and I wanted to lessen that for her any way I could.  The problem was her initial reaction was anger, calling me immature, stating that this is all bullshit, etc, etc.  What surprised me most though, was how quickly she started talking about money.   **She wants me to pay for the following:**  * $240 for a bass guitar she got me for my birthday, a little less than two weeks ago.  Admittedly, around the time of my birthday I was playing with the idea of breaking up.  * $100 difference between our ""promise rings""  (I paid about $250 for hers, she paid about $350 for mine).  * $100 my friends allegedly stole from her at a party.    **Before I ask for your take, I'll just explain my current position on all of this:**  * I like the bass a good bit, she did a nice job picking it out for me.  I'm actually okay with paying her for it, since I do like it a good bit and can see myself using it a lot.  But I'm not sure if paying her for it is the right thing to do or not.  I offered initially to give it back, and she could sell it, she gave me a bitchy look.  * The rings?  Fuck that, I've got a useless ring too, we were dumb, deal with it.  * I'm almost 99% sure my friends didn't steal her money that night.  It was a New Year's party, she left her purse on the dining room table with a bunch of other peoples' belongings and the following day she had about $100 in Christmas money from her grandma missing.  She insists it was my friends, but I really don't see any of them doing that to her or me.  I'm much more suspicious of the host's 14 year old brother's friend who was enjoying picking fights with all of the older folks.  We kicked them out eventually, I'm assuming they came back and raided everyone's stuff (the theft had to have happened while everyone was sleeping, as I spent the majority of my night in/near the dining room).  So basically, fuck that too.  So what does everyone think?  (Besides that promise rings are stupid, because I got to hear that from every single male friend I encountered and mistakenly fist-bumped.)  ***tl;dr  --  I broke up with my girlfriend, she says I need to pay for a $200 birthday gift, $100 ring price difference, $100 she had stolen from her.  What do?***",relationshipadvice

I dont' know how long you have been dating, but if you dated a sufficient amount of time before moving in then it would seem you have been together for awhile.  Remember that he is younger than you.  He may be totally sure that he wants to marry you, but worries about the fact that he is so young and is trying to take it nice and slow.  You need to be understanding of that, but don't let him be the one who is making all the decisions.. if that makes sense.  Tell him how you feel.  Don't be accusing at all, that just hurts things.  Just explain that you are having a really hard time with the move, that you want to be with him, but he is asking a lot of you and you are feeling unsure.  Keep in mind that this MIGHT hurt him.  You want a commitment right now... but he is also looking for some sort of commitment by asking you to move with him.  If you are unsure about the move... then how can he be sure that you would want to marry him in the distant future.  Maybe a compromise can be made?  Maybe ask him to give you a time frame for when he is willing to get engaged/get married.  Explain that your time frame is NOW. That you want to be with him right now, but that you will be willing to wait (assuming you are)  as long as he gives you a decent time frame.  Maybe his idea is in a year or so?  Maybe it's in 3 years?  figure out how long you are willing to wait and then be flexible.  Don't push your boundaries too far without expecting him to meet you halfway, but don't push him into getting engaged/married until he is definitely ready.

OP says “tenant moved out and hasn’t paid me, I’ll text her.” Tenant then informs OP that she is indeed still planning on living there, and did not officially move out.   In my eyes, the tenant informed OP that she is not abandoning their tenancy *before* OP informed the tenant of his wish to terminate the lease. It also appears to me that OP has forgiven the lack of rent and as such continued the tenancy agreement with the tenant despite her living somewhere else and not paying rent. With that said, I think OP needs to formally tell the tenant their wish to cancel the agreement and give the 15 day notice.   Am I wrong in my line of thinking?",legaladvice

c97pjp6,1bkbh2,RomanticsPerspective,"Just try and talk to her. Don't be try and rush. I met my girlfriend when I was sixteen. We only knew each other a month before we started dating, and we are going on 4 years now. The best advice I can give you is just try and set up a relationship in which you two confide in each other, but aren't exactly friends. So if you are friends with her right now, back really far off, but slowly. Before diving for the emotional relationship, you need to only be an acquaintance. When you guys have a bit of space, start talking to her more. Slowly work your way up until you two are texting all the time. When you two become closer, try and hang out with her in an environment that isolates you two together. Ask her to the movies, or if that isn't something either of you enjoy, go for a walk in a park, or if either of you have dogs, go to a dog park. The goal is to become very close to each other without entering the friendzone. Even if all of these things go well, one thing you have to remember is that every individual has a set of characteristics that he or she desires in a partner. Even if you do everything right, she just might not be interested in you. Last but not least, be confident. Confidence is the most important aspect of beginning a relationship. Not only should you desire to be in a relationship, but try and make her want to be in a relationship with you. Just don't try and change who you are so appeal to her. If things don't work out, they just don't work out. My plan has worked for about five of my friends, and three of them are still in the said relationship. The experience should be fun and exciting, not scary. Good luck friend.",relationshipadvice

1navji,1navji,,"Ill try to make a long story short. Him and i dated for a few months a few years ago and then broke it off. I never lost the feelings i had for him and he claims to have always had feelings for me. For years we maintained a sexual relationship even though we weren't together. He would tell me he just isnt ready to be in a relationship and I, like a fool, not only believed him but i waited around, hoping that once he was ready he would choose me. Fast forward. I find out he has a gf but by the time i found out they had already broken up. I was devastated and we didn't speak at all for a few mibths but like always we ended right back up talking and eventually fooling around. I STILL liked him so much. Well to be honest...i loved him. I told him this time around that if he's seeing someone or starts to see someone just tell me. I know it sounds pathetic but i didnt want to be a side chick i just wanted to enjoy the time we were spending together.   In march of this year i found out i was preggers and he is the father. When i told him he flipped shit and wanted me to get an abortion and when i didn't he barely spoke to me for five months. I tried everything to get him to talk to me and pretty much settled on the fact that he just wouldn't be around. The very end of july he suddenly comes around and wants to be in our childs life. I thought this was great but he was still acting so suspicious. I finally find out that he had been seeing someone since feb and pretty much cheated on her with me and got me pregnant. Idk what he has said to her to make her stay with him after that but they are still together.  I know the majority of this is my fault. I should've walked away when i saw that he was playing games. But idk what to do. He says he wants to be a father but whenever he's with her he completely ignores my phone calls and text messages regardless of what i may need. He's still totally playing games. He even told me he loves her but when he's with me he can himself with me forever. Its all bull shit. Tonight was my breaking point. Im now 6 months and i desperately needed help with something (personal) tonight. He told me he was preoccupied which is code for he's with his gf and then he never even hit me back or called to make sure everything was alright.

Gone is the happy, enjoyable personality he had and in has come a jaded, depressed husband who smokes a lot and feels unhappy thinking about work. This happened only a week ago. He told me last Tuesday his job ends on 5th June and he starts his new role on 9th June 2015.   Apparently this is due to work issues, he's told me the boss has demoted him from head of promotions / PR to ""underwear manager"" (a job title the boss invented) and he has to strip-search the employees in a private room to check if they're carrying drugs in their underwear (it did happen a few years back with a bag of cocaine in someone's undies in the toilet, and people called in Cokeundiesgate) as they enter the premises - he works in PR for a small firm that sells goods online. He says he feels humiliated and it's a waste of his skills.  Also, considering he works in PR, won't/couldn't this be in a ""worst PR disasters""-type thing?  He's still kind and caring, he's not changed in that way, he's still trying to be romantic. But he's taken to smoking as an attempt to cope with it, he never used to smoke before.  He asked me for help, and I offered to help him, he accepted. We've always had a great relationship, and this is one time where I thought I COULD help him, but have I tried to take on too much?  I suggested he tells his boss he's quitting or leaving, and he agreed with me, but there's an issue there; he can't work for anyone else in the same industry in our city due to a non-compete clause in his contract prohibiting him from working for another employer within 20 miles of his current one. He worried he wouldn't be able to get another PR job easily. He said he needs to pay the bills, but strip-searching people when you've never been taught how to do it (his boss expects him to *just do it* automatically)?; too weird, isn't it?  Why would his boss do this to him? I often hear from friends, co-workers etc. how good he is at his job, and I'm worried about him.  This is affecting our marriage in 3 ways; one, he's not wanting sex much, if at all, but he's still romantic in other ways (meals, presents etc.), two, he's having nightmares about the whole thing, and, three, he feels humiliated by his new job title.  How can I deal with this?  If we sued his employer, it'd be on public record, and wouldn't look good to a future employer, but if we don't take action, his boss will continue to get away with it, so what do we do, basically?  If your boss was like this, and imposed such a contract on you, what would you do?  I should add, we're in the UK so American legal advice is useless to us.  Rachel",legaladvice

kt6n1,kt6n1,anarlape,"My girlfriend of one year says she loves me dearly but is losing her attraction in me. I feel like I've been an attentive lover (holding her orgasm above mine) and that I have satisfied her needs sexually (she has never said there was a problem and has stated that she loves the way we have sex) but for some reason she has lost interest. I have asked her about it, and I don't think the problem is the sex, but somehow I'm not attractive to her? We've had a rocky past couple of months (worked out mostly now), and I think it's likely because sex between us is emotional. Anyway, I'm just worried she doesn't find me attractive anymore.

When I came back, i saw that my car wasn’t there so I’m assuming it’s been towed.   Is there any recourse for me if:  a) the unauthorized parking sign had no phone number or any contact information  b) the police/DMV have not been informed (I checked with the local police department and they said they had no info of it being towed)  I know I did an incredibly stupid thing, so I’m trying to see if there’s anything I can do to minimize it.  Edit: Suppose I do not fight it in court (because as you said, i knowingly Parker illegally) but inform them of their misdemeanor under Section 22658(m), is it extortion or blackmail if we privately reach a settlement?

7xvokn,7xvokn,theresnostringsonme,"Need to know what steps I need to take, and what actions I CAN take, concerning the following situation.    In 2013, I was hired by a small publishing house to do some graphic design work for them. This included but was not limited to book covers for digital and print purposes, as well as marketing material designs in the form of bookmarks and the like. The publishing house is located in CA, and is a small company. I am a single freelance designer who, at the time, operated out of PA.   While some bills have been paid from the company, there is an outstanding balance roughly to the tune of $400 that remains unpaid. Multiple attempts to collect have fallen on deaf ears. I freely admit to making the mistake of doing business with them, as the owner was a friend at the time, and now a former friend I have zero contact with (due to unrelated circumstances).    Currently, the items that have not been paid for are being used to sell copies of books online (ebook) and some in paperback (to purchase online and possibly in some small stores in CA). The owner of the publishing house has also taken the copyrighted designs I have supplied and used them to create sequel covers with alternate designers, without my consent. It's very clear that the owner does not intend to ever pay for the work I have supplied, but will continue to use it to sell product.   What are my options for action in this situation?

12oq2o,12oq2o,Mem2lga,"Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this  Before I begin, let's backup a year from today. Senior in college with a job offer in hand in NYC. Dating girl for about a month, really like each other, everything is going well, we date for about 7-8 months and are as serious as you can be as college seniors. She's going to be in NYC after grad as well, we know of each others families really well and want to make it work long term. Summer comes, know we won't see each other for 4 months. About 3 weeks into the summer, long distance is getting rough and we break up. To be clear, she broke up with me and it killed me that she was ok with that given all the things we talked about future wise. Worst summer of my life, fwp I know. I eventually got over her on my own, not by hooking up with other chicks or dating someone. I knew I had to do that on my own before I started even thinking about dating.   2 months ago move to nyc, start work meet a good group of people my age same interests/careers through my brother.  Have the mindset that I have a good two years to not worry about trying to find a girl. At the same time however, I feel that if I meet the right girl, I'm not going to be like oh I'm only 22, and miss out on finding ""the one.""    So I meet the girl that is the reason for this post about 6 weeks ago. We're the same place career wise, similar values, interests and get along really well. We both like each other and go on some dates, hang out in the park, bfgf stuff. So we're dating.   I'm at this point now where I'm on cusp of falling really, really hard for this girl. I know what I would want in a significant other and while I don't plan on getting married for at least 2-3 years, I know I want to be serious with her.   But at the same time I'm afraid of having my heart broken again. Now don't misinterpret that as me being unsure, I'm 100% sure that she's the one I want to bring home. I guess what I want to know is if she feels the same way.   A little background about her, just graduated in may, never been in a serious relationship. She's a good girl. Very smart, not one to make rash decisions. Also every guy in our social circles is all over her so she can easily go with any guy she wants. But she's told me she's really into me, I actually met her older brother a few days ago, big deal for her as she has mentioned before that any guy she would be serious about would have to meet and be approved by him.   So she's into it, I'm into it, what's the problem? Well up until this point our jobs have been pretty chill so we've had time to meet up quite often. But starting in the next week or so we'll start traveling a great deal for work, Monday-Thursdays, leaving only the weekends.   How should I balance out our work and home lives? We haven't discussed it yet, but I'm sure we will in the next few days and I need some ideas suggestions I can throw her way.   I really like this girl and she's already thinking long term..I think? she suggested we book tickets to a concert in march, so it's not a ""oh I'm bored at home let me date someone"" type situation for her either.    Also for those of you with experience in these situations, do you have any advice on how to make this work long term?

ltiuu,ltiuu,,"I can elaborate, but for now I'll keep it short. On and off girlfriend, currently off. She's going to university about a 2 hour drive away. Whenever I seem to be well adjusted, she ups her romanticism and talks like she wants me, and wants to see me and stuff. I hadn't seen her for about two weeks, and then I went up yesterday because I had a day off and she said she wanted to see me.   Things were a bit suspicious. I surprised her, and then we went to her room and she went in first and put something away (which I'm now wondering whether it was someone else's underwear, but she said it was hers.) Later, we started cuddling because it's what we both wanted. Things escalated, and she told me to grab a condom (which I asked why she had it, and she said her guy friends treated her like a 'bro' and wanted her to be safe.) Then, afterwards, she said she had another in her purse. She said that it was in case her 'bros' needed one. So there are two suspicious things, but probably what makes me most uncomfortable is that we hadn't had sex in a month. Whenever we refrained for even a week, it hurt her. This time it didn't, and I asked her, and she just shrugged it off.   So I'm not sure where we are, and I don't know what she's been doing, and I'm just confused. I've never had a doubt in my mind that I want to be with her, but on multiple occasions she's stuttered, in a sense, and been unsure. Not so long ago she had said something along the lines of 'he's not someone you would want to just hook up with', in regards to a friend who is now interested in her. So, what? She's looking to hook up with people? Anyways, this seems to be a fucked up little relationship. I don't want it to end, but I don't know what to do.",relationshipadvice

Pretty much nothing changed in our relationship except the label of boyfriend girlfriend. But, the whole reason we broke up, is because she realized she's polyamorous. I told her I couldn't deal with not being the only guy that she is emotionally and physically committed to, and we agreed to break up. She's honestly my best friend, and I still love her. I really can't see a way of me not bring in love with her. But my problem is that, it'll be an issue if I enter another relationship. I'll still be in love with her, and I feasibly can't date her.

pwcno,pwcno,,"So basically as the story goes... Right as graduating highschool, I dated a girl for two weeks and then asked her our. We;ve been together for two years now.  During this time, I've helped her with everything. She's an immigrant and is very family oriented. I helped her learn how to be herself, i basically got her into college, shes NOT independent. even though she wants to be and apologizes (but apologies dont do anything). She is VERY SWEET. She cooks, tries to do what she can to help (but thats almost never), and half the time I feel like i'm taking care of her. HOWEVER. I love her very much, los virginity together, gotten through some tough stuff together, my family loves her her family loves me. etc....  Now, for the past 3months i've been super busy at school. BEFORE i used to really want to be near her whenever I had free time, but now its always such an effort that i dont really want too. This led to fights and me getting irritated about litte things here and there.... During these past 3 months we've almost broken up numerous times Each time was a very intense fight, and then promising eachother we'd be together forever (lol) Even now when things are ok, I dont see myself liek i did before. I dont really go out of my way for her like i sued to, I dont have that spark and desire like i used too, but i still love her.  Our relationship is also very serious, but we fight like... once a week over stupid stuff (fights last about 2 hrs.). Seeing that adults really ARE just grown up kids, I want to have a relationship like the parents from ""Easy A"" fun chill relaxed, not all serious and boring.   But at the problem is- before, we used to have that fun relationship, but for the past 6months is has died down, and now it is dull and I dont know whether I should wait and see if we can turn it around, or just to giveup and try with my friend who I know would date me before damaging my current gf anymore.  Not to mention current GF's dad died 10 years ago, mom is single, and she has big attachment issues. I dont want to hurt her, but I also dont wanna waste my life, maybe I promised her too much from the start? i dont wanna bet he asshole here.  Advice PLEASE!",relationshipadvice

cef9i2o,1u0dee,thisgirlisonfaya,"Here is a bit of advice from someone who has experienced this too but on the opposite end. When I was a junior in hs I had been in a 1 1/2 year relationship with a guy who graduated when I was a sophomore. Well that year I met another guy who was a senior (my current SO of 3 years). He and I developed an amazing friendship and eventually began going to Waffle House every weekend. All the while I was completely open with my boyfriend, telling him every time we went with no lies at all. Eventually I developed feelings for the new guy. At this point I began making excuses about why I couldn't see him. I would ignore his texts and pretend not to see him at school. Naturally he was pretty upset-he later admitted to me that he was at this point positive he was in love with me. So when he confronted me I got caught up in my lies and it came out that I had developed feelings for him. He then admitted his for me. I immediately told my boyfriend and he reacted exactly as you have. He told me that we could move on, etc, etc, etc. Here is where this becomes relevant:   After we got everything out in the open I felt miserable. I would see the other guy everywhere and my heart would sink every time. I felt so confused that I began to get distant with my boyfriend... I regretted my decision. All I could think about was someone else. Honestly, and especially if this has happened before and she acted differently, I think you should talk with her because chances are she is having second thoughts. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if she is distancing herself, she probably is, as I did, beginning to resent you and feel confusion about your relationship. I stayed with my boyfriend for about 2 weeks after confessing my feelings to him and finally I sat him down to talk. Breaking it off with him was the best decision I could have made.  TALK TO HER. Give her the chance to leave and figure it out if she has to. Not to be cliche but you know how the saying goes ""If you love her let her go. If it is meant to be she will come back.""

We constantly argue and she is not an understanding person or someone who is easy to get along with. Honestly a majority of her downfalls outweigh her good qualities. She is a senior on high school and I'm a freshman in college about an hour away. I drive home every weekend to see her and the long distance puts a strain on us.

You see, last year I broke up with a girl who I loved but things weren't working. I ended it. I regretted ending that relationship for over a year and was constantly depressed. I even contemplated suicide (luckily all is well now). Because of my previous experience with breaking up with my last girlfriend, I don't want to repeat that. I don't want to feel depressed and miss her. I am scared because of my previous experience with ending a relationship.

She's always been on the pill, ever since I've known her, and now she's finding she is having some reactions to it - some spots and sensitive nipples.   So she went to the doctor and she says she's thinking of getting the coil instead, to alleviate the side affects. My concern is that when she comes off the pill, she'll lose her attraction to me (as [various articles](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=birth-control-pills-affect-womens-taste) point out, girls on the pill are 'fooling' their bodies into thinking they're pregnant, making them more attracted to 'nice' guys, and when they come off it they are suddenly fertile and want a manly man instead). Now, I'm a 'nice' guy and to be honest, I fully expect this to happen.  I haven't shared my concerns with her (not really sure whether it's a good idea or not).

I dated this girl on and off for a year and a half (although we were together for only about 10 months of it or so) and after multiple times where she physically assaulted me or treated me like shit I ended up breaking up with her for good. She has multiple psychotic issues which have been diagnosed after we broke up (she thought that seeing a shrink like I had asked while we were dating would make me want to get back together with her) and basically I have been completely over the relationship since well before the break-up happened. It has been like 6 months or longer since I have spoken to her although she still attempts to talk to me or contact me. I have decided to avoid these attempts because she is positive that we will end up together even though I have made it clear that I harbor no feelings besides rage towards her anymore.  Well, I am a college student who happens to be back in my home town for the break and luckily have been able to avoid my ex. Well, last night one of my friends told me he was getting a group of people together to go to a local club. I decided to go and met up with a group of friends and 2 people who are more of acquaintances, of of them being my exes best friend. I come to find out that this girl and my ex have fallen out and have not spoken for longer than me and my ex have (no surprise, as previously stated the girl is crazy). We all hung out and had a good time although my conversations with the friend were kind of short and awkward. After a drunk trip to Denny's I received a text from the best friend asking if I thought that it was odd that the entire night we hung out she wanted to fuck me. I, in a drunk and horny state, encouraged the behavior. Today I accidentally encountered the chick at her place of business and more flirting ensued, and basically what I am wondering is if I am in the wrong perusing a sexual encounter with this girl. She is beautiful and it would be a No Strings Attached encounter since we are both going up to school, however the only reason we know each other is through my ex. Redditors, am I in the wrong for wanting to fuck my exes former best friend? And if given the opportunity should I go for it?  TL;DR: An opportunity might have arisen for me to have sex with my exes former best friend. should I go for it?  edit: throwaway account  edit2: I have also been talking to this girl in the town where I go to school and we are kind of an item but we are not officially together which is a major part of the problem I left out.

qfah1,qfah1,ditto5000,"I'm 23 she's 25. Met her in a bar for about 5 minutes but had to leave because I wasn't feeling well. She was with a group of people, one of those people I knew from a long time ago. She asked the dude for my last name and she essentially facebook stalked me. She added me but I wasn't all that interested because I thought she might have had some surface issues...accusations I was making from the 5 minutes I talked to her. I figured I just go with it, she's attractive...why not? Well we get to talking and I find out she likes weed...a lot. When I found that out, I changed my mind automatically and felt like we should hang out. Well, she initially asked me to hang out...but like I said I kind of brushed her off for what I thought were surface issues...So I told her I was busy this week but maybe later. When I found out about the weed I was amped. She asked again when we were hanging out so I bit and said lets do it tonight. So I went over to her place we smoked up and I made the first move. I kissed her and that was about all we did. I found out I had a lot more in common with her than a lot of other girls and I think she might have realized that too. The next day she asked me to go out to dinner with her friends...it's some kind of ritual they do during the week. I told her I was down and went. She introduced all her friends and explained a little of their backgrounds too me...so that made me almost confident she was interested. After we were finished eating we all walked over to a bar down the street. She was dancing with one of her dude friends...nothing like grinding or anything...just what girls do? She was looking at me a lot whenever she would do it and I would just smile...I'm not sure if she was trying to gauge my reaction or what. I asked her if she wanted to go outside to my truck and smoke...she was down. We went out there and she told me a lot about her past and we just kind of shared stories. At some point she was so high I think she slipped and said ""I can't believe I'm saying this all to a guy I'm dat..."" and it cut off. She tried to play it off as being high but it got my gears going. It didn't turn me off because I really do think she's a cool chick...but then when we go back to the bar she goes to the bathroom and one of her girlfriends comes over and talks to me.  She starts asking me what I'm looking for and all this in her. I said I'm not really sure. She went on to say that she dates like a guy...she gets in relationships and gets scared and bails. She said ""these guys were really awesome guys...awesome jobs...very attractive...I just want to know what you're looking for."" I said I really didn't know...I thought she was a cool chick and I was just winging it. Then something strange happened...for me at least. She asked me if I was on facebook and to give it to her...so I did. She added me. During this time the girl I'm with was on the other side of the bar just kind of looking...observing I guess. That's when I went and hung out with her a bit. We drove in separate vehicles because we live so out of the way of each other. After playing the bar game with her for about 10 minutes...I left. I told everyone bye and her friend wanted me to come out with them again next week. Her friend was also under the impression that she's been knowing me for a while.    So she had plans to go out of town this weekend with some friends and left yesterday. She told me 2 days ago she was sick and was hoping she would get better before she had to start driving. She also asked me to hangout whenever she got back from her trip. I said I was down. The next day I text her a picture of my lunch with a little joke...nothing over the top or anything. I followed it up with how was she feeling. She never text me back and it's been 2 days. I'm not freaking out...or being that guy...I just want to get some input from you guys.    I think she might be playing games to see if I'm interested. I haven't texted her again since she hasn't text me back. If she is playing games I'm really trying to play the whole hard to get thing...I just don't get why she wouldn't text me for 2 whole days after she's the one that's been hitting me up.

It's not that we didn't want to be friends, we just took different paths/hung out with different people. Anyway, I've recently reconnected with her, and she's showing interest in me. I'm all for it, except for the fact that every time we hang out she gets super drunk. I like to drink myself (see: username), but when it happens, she always wants me to come back to her apt. I don't care that she drinks, but I feel bad that she's so drunk and wants me to spend the night. She's very attractive and I'd love to, but I'm too nice of a guy to ""take advantage"" of her. I don't want her to think I'm not interested in her, because I definitely am. I just don't want it to happen under those circumstances, if that makes any sense?

1t5n12,1t5n12,throwawaymark1,"Hello Reddit. This would be my first legit post, so please be gentle. Also, side note, terribly sorry for the huge text. Unfortunately to understand my position it takes quite a bit of back story and I’m sorry for that.   	 So, the story starts in freshman year of college, I had met a pretty chill chick and I had a pretty big crush on her. I pushed too hard and she pulled back. Shit ton of drama happens and I am a wimp who won’t confess. Within all the time of the drama, there was a plan. I had a wing man. It was a good friend of mine. The plan was for my wing man to get to know the crush and report back and help me get closer to her, the “sling-shot effect”. My plan was to get close to the best friend at the time to then get closer to the crush, another “sling-shot” effect. It takes me until the summer of freshman year to confess to her and I get turned down pretty hard. I try not to cry, cry anyways.  	 It takes me the entire rest of the summer to semi get over this girl. I fell for her, and I fell hard. I met a few other girls here and there during the summer, but each of them were just replacements for her. They all had some sort of attribute that is similar to her. I only realize now that during that time of me trying to cope, I never got over her. I did talk to some of my closer friends about this and it did not go anywhere. Sure they told me to just get over her and move on, but I have tried constantly and it has not worked.  	 Now fast forward to current day. Things are “normal” between me and the crush and we still joke around. My feeling are still the same as ever, even after being turned down. The best friend and the crush are no longer that close. My wing man has gotten very close to the crush, and has stopped reporting back to me. I presume it is to help me get over the crush but it still doesn't feel right.   	 So now after all this back story, on to the problem. My crush has gotten into a relationship over the course of the college year. Things ended badly with that relationship, and I tried to comfort her but, she did not want to talk to me. This happened back during the winter break of 2012. Now it is winter break of 2013, and she has fallen for yet another person. (Not me if you haven’t figured out)  	 So, I know that my chances are slim to none, but I must ask. Is there even a chance. If there is, how should I approach it?  If there is not, how should I deal with this, or rather, what should I do? I understand that if I actually like this girl, I should prioritize her happiness, and I have for a long time, but it hurt me very deeply when she was hurt before. Now I’m scared as to how I would feel if/when my crush gets together with another person. It hurts me to see myself like this. I understand that I should move on, but for some reason I cannot. Again I apologize for the length but this has been cut down a lot.   	 Thank you Reddit for any and all help that you can give me.",relationshipadvice

We got to know each other over a course of three weeks, and after a strange process, began dating on the fourth week. Things were great! Everything was perfect for me, and her, in the time period we dated, approximately three weeks. We broke up because of some insecurities she had, that others were using against her to keep her unhappy, which led to her thinking she wasn't good enough to date me. I was devastated. I lost all motivation for around a month. Now, I'm happy like I used to be. She went through another relationship in that time in which the guy cheated on her. When it ended, I started talking to her again. Here's what I need your help with: I still very much like this girl, I really want to get back together with her. I've openly told her my feelings, and during our everyday conversations, I often bring up how nice she looked, or things of the sort. I often will send pictures with some kind of cute quote on it, and nearly always a good morning/goodnight text. She seems to at least slightly reciprocate these feelings. Am I being too clingy? I text her quickly after, if not as soon as, I'm available. I often feel like I annoy her. (she says I don't, but I think I do.) I just don't know. What can I do to better my chances? To come off less clingy? Any advice you're willing to give me is greatly appreciated.     Sorry it got kind of unorganized towards the end.",relationshipadvice

You will know when you meet someone who is both but it might take time (I'm 28, it took me years). However, I agree with the not being an asshole about it part. If you think you love somebody, you should try to understand her, to really make an effort to understand what she is going through. It might hurt but that's the best you can do. You will never get to understand her neither by smothering her with your needs nor by acting like you don't care. Everyone will say ""be cool about it"" but we all know that's almost impossible when it comes to ""dream girls"". And yes, she could be lying (probably not to hurt you) but you're very young and life is all about the ups and downs so I really think you should not walk away. Find special ways to let her know you care (without begging her to take you back). Be nice to her. Don't buy that shit about girls not wanting nice guys.

So I feel that she would have been wiling to hold off on sex to prove that it doesn't mean EVERYTHING to her as it would seem to mean EVERYTHING to me. Sex is all the time with the new gf, but I am a very conscious person so it's not as enjoyable than the previous.  As lame as it sounds, from what I can figure on Facebook I can come to the conclusion she is not involved with a new guy.  But it is a possibility.

qdi48,qdi48,201smellsfunny,"So... here's the deal. Started dating a girl. Things are going along great for quite some time, and we start talking about marriage and starting a life together. Our relationship is great - enjoy the same things, share the same values and goals, don't argue or fight, etc. Before too long, she's begging me to propose, so we start looking at rings, I talk to her dad, etc. She's constantly telling me how she loves me more every day, grows more attracted to me every day, can't wait to spend her life with me.  Then, one day, she says she's having doubts. We talk about it and she figures it's probably nothing. But, over the next while, these ""doubts"" keep coming back. So I ask her why she's doubting us. She says she wishes she ""didn't worry so much about the relationship."" So I ask what she's worried about. She says she worries that she ""feels that maybe we're not right for each other."" (In my mind, this is all circular so far... doubts = worries = feeling things aren't right.) So I ask her why she thinks we're not right for each other. Nothing. No reason.  She says she's attracted to me. She says she loves spending time with me. She says I treat her better than she could ask. She says she thinks we have a great, healthy relationship. On every dimension of the relationship, she thinks things are perfect. Despite her saying nothing is wrong, I renew my efforts to be sweet, to encourage her, to show her my love and affection - working a little harder to let her know we really have a good thing going.  So, long story short, we eventually break up over the doubts. And she still can't tell me what was wrong...  As a side note, I've had 2 friends recently go through the same thing. Long-time girlfriend says everything is perfect in the relationship (attraction, affection, fun together, etc.) but yet they also say some variant of ""I have doubts"". Ends up killing the relationship after guy does everything he can to show her his love.  As a second side note, my ex was previously dating a massive douche nozzle. She was head over heels for him and crushed for months when they broke up, despite the fact that he had always treated her like crap. She doesn't seem upset at all at losing me.

1dj2rs,1dj2rs,Berglund0661,"Hey Reddit. I have an outstanding problem that has been going in for quite a while and I have looked everywhere for an answer. Hopefully you guys can give me one.   My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 2 and a half years. We could never be happier. She's amazing. I couldn't ask for any better from her.   But there is one problem. Her dad thinks I'm an asshole.   Now before you start saying ""well, what did you do!?"" Or ""you probably are an asshole"" listen  I haven't met him.  Yes the man that hates me, haven't even seen my face. And I have been dating his daughter for over 2 years.  And this is not a simple fix; Her mother is really sweet. One of the nicest people I know and constantly apologizes for his inexcusable behavior.   Backstory: My girlfriend dated 2 guys previous to me many months apart. One of them was only for a month. Nothing happened. Nothing serious. The other was for three months. Nothing serious. But the guy was a fucking nutcase.   She broke up with him after realizing he destroys people's properties for fun. And now very well known to the police. After she left him. He didn't take that so well and starred to verbally harass her dad at every bar he went to. And destroy her house, threats In the mail, Facebook. Everything. Yet police do nothing even with this evidence. Just recently he egged and destroyed my girlfriends houses garden. And messages her after saying it wasn't him. (We never asked)  I would kill this kid. If I could. But with my job I have now. I would be screwed. I work for the city, and if I get pinned i loose a lot of employability. I'm getting on my last nerve with him. We informed the police. But they said ""we know about him stop Calling us. Please""  Anyway. Off topic.  Her dad thinks I am the same as This stupid motherfucker. So he treats me as such. Even though he has never met me  Some things you may need to know about him: He's 67 years old. So he's pretty old schooled. (My girlfriend is 19 her parents just had her late) Alcoholic.  Verbally abuses her and her mom  Refuses to go to family therapy because he thinks he's always right No matter what.   If he were to ever lay a hand on her. I would be there in a heartbeat    I've been thinking of ways to approach this. She recently went to California to visit family with her mom. Her dad was left at the house.   One of the guitarists from my band lives a street up. And it took so much for me not to go to her house on the way to his.  But I know if I do it would just cause more problems towards her. Being yelled at constantly for things that never happened. Having to drive his sorry old ass to and from the bar.   I honestly have run out of ideas. Her family always asks when I will be coming over for dinner or to meet the rest f the family. And it pains her to say that It can't happen.   So reddit. What in the name of glob do I do?   TL;DR girlfriend who I've been with for over 2 years' dad hates me even though he's never met me because of her previous experience With her ex who vandalized her house and continues to do so.

My grandmother was abusive to my mother from childhood through adulthood. The abuse ranged from manipulation of close family to seed distrust and conflict, to threats of violence against my mother, threats of harm at her mentally handicapped son, and much much more I have yet to uncover. This behavior catalyzed what I can only describe as PTSD in my mother. Recently, my grandmother began showing symptoms of dementia. These symptoms are quite evident to those close to her. She occasionally forgets who I am (she only has two grandchildren), what my mother did for a living, or any conversations she had just days before. She does, however, conceal her dementia quite well to people she doesn't know and meets briefly. Several months ago, her high-functioning mentally handicapped son escaped her home, unbeknownst to her, after being in her ""care"" for 40+ years. After enjoying no independence his entire life, he suddenly snapped. Since then, she's been calling my mother five times a day, without fail, for random trivialities or to instigate vitriolic verbal fights. I am witnessing my mother suffer to a degree I have never before seen, and I need it to end. We tried tactfully approaching the topic of assisted living, but my grandmother affirms her independence. She refuses any medical care, she refuses to stop driving (which is clearly dangerous), and she's impossible to convince for absolutely anything. We need to get her there as soon as possible for our peace of mind (to put it lightly) and her safety. What legal tools can we utilize to expedite the process? I don't want to wait for a killed pedestrian or my mother committing suicide to be the wake-up call.",legaladvice

s7l6h,s7l6h,kidnoj,"Okay, in order to understand my dilemma, I have to explain my first relationship. End of high school, I got into a relationship with another girl, and at the time, looking back at it now, I’m pretty sure it was more because I was lonely, or rather, I just wanted to experience a relationship. Stupid, I know, I’ve learned. We broke up after a torturous half year (I lost interest fast, but me being the jackass that I am, I didn’t have the heart to break it off for the longest time). Anyways, after that, I had realized that I could never go into a relationship again unless I knew that I really did like the girl. Here’s the problem though, after that relationship, when it came to the opposite gender, I began to self analyze myself in every possible way when it came to looking for a girl. That’s when this new girl comes in. I’m like a lot of other Asian guys, I like to look at super attractive, model-like Asian girls and even I think it would be cool to have one like that. However, some aspects of myself analyzation, I wish I would never have realized. Basically, this girl, she makes me happy as hell, butterflies in my stomach, you know, clichéd stuff. However, when it comes to physical looks, she’s probably like a 6 or 7.  Here is where I am torn: I realize that she is not much of a looker, but then I tell myself that it’s not about looks. She makes me happy right? That’s all that should matter! But then, I also think to myself, “well...you’ve always wanted a super attractive girl that can turn heads though right?” Then I think to myself again, “Well, that’s the wrong mentality to have. It’s not all about looks. Besides, any other girl is probably out of your league (I’m a socially awkward penguin, I swear)”. Of course, upon further thinking, “Out of my league? Well that’s just not fair to you OR the girl. Are you saying that you only want to go after her because there’s no one better? Asshole.” But then, “No, I don’t want to be an asshole...maybe I just want to be in another relationship...but of course, that’s the wrong reason to go for this...” Basically, I am totally confused right now, and I don’t know if I should trust my feelings. In the case for the first girl, I knew that she and I would not work, but it’s like I told myself this lie that it would work out, while I subconsciously told myself, “Dude, stop bullshitting yourself. She’s not your type. And you’re probably starting to hate even looking at her.” It also pains me to admit that I am shallow as hell, but not much of a looker myself. All these thoughts have made me hesitant on pursuing this new girl now.  **TL;DR I really like this new girl, but whenever I think about trying to go for her, I question whether or not my feelings for her are legitimate or out of loneliness. **",relationshipadvice

We became pretty close friends-she's one of the few people at my school who I consider an intellectual peer (I'm 16, go to a public high school in New York), and she's kind of awesome in too many ways to explain. Over the course of our relationship, I've liked her several times. I'm a fairly confident, attractive guy, but she's never returned the affections even though I'm fairly sure she's not out of my league. Despite that, we've become closer over the years to the point that I'd say she's without a doubt one of my best friends. Last summer we started cuddling, hugging, hanging out a lot, but she made it clear that she wasn't interested in me. As this year progressed, we became closer and closer until we had sort of a friends-with-benefits situation. However, she maintains that she isn't interested in me and is ""only attracted to me for my body"". I, however, am attracted to her for a lot more-everything that counts, in my opinion. She's fun, intelligent, nice, creative, funny, damn sexy-and I have no idea what to do about it. She's said to me and others that she has no interest, but we hook up every time we're together. Reddit, what should I do? TL;DR: Best-friend-with-benefits is causing me some serious emotional confusion-we hook up, I like her, she insists she's not attracted to me. HELP!

xgj2k,xgj2k,,"Hi Long story short, my friend tried hooking me up with a girl who is one of his good friends, she's got a boyfriend though. Thing is, he never shows her attention, she always has to meet on his terms, she always has to engage him on conversation, ect.   Normally I'm not the guy to advance on a girl if she has a boyfriend, but when I talked to her about him she reassures me that she's done with him and he just frustrates her.. But, she says that he treats her like a queen when she is with him, but it's a chore to get him to hang out.  Knowing this I went ahead and continued talking to this girl. Let me tell you, she is awesome, and doesn't deserve how she's currently being treated.   Well my buddy and I plan a trip to Georgia for a week and he invites his girlfriend and tells me to invite the girl so I do, and she accepts. Everything is cool leading up to the time of the trip (about a month) but she has still yet to break up with her boyfriend.   On the trip, I make moves and attempt to advance a few times but the responses are hazy. Example, we've slept in the same bed in the hotel, and Ive put my arm around her at one point, from the judgement of my friend and his girlfriend, (they keep telling me she's really interested in me and to just go with the flow for the trip) well she freezes when I put my arm around her and does not move. So after a few minutes I think she's uncomfortable so I back off. This is just one instance.  My buddy will pull her aside and talk to her about me, and try to see what she's thinking about. And she says she's always glad and happy that I make moves but she said she's just conflicted in her head. Towards the middle of the trip (last night lol) we make these plans to chill and drink in the hotel. After the drinks have been pored she gets a phone call and leaves, an hour goes by and my buddy goes to check on her, she's talking to her boyfriend. Another half hour goes by and she comes in, still talking to him. Another hour goes by, still talking to him. She keeps going over how she can't wait to hang with him, and how she misses him. By the time she hangs up, my drunken ass rolls over and just says screw it, and I fall asleep.   My buddy was furious with her and talks to her, she keeps saying that she's just conflicted. My buddy says there's still hope and she feels something about me, and to continue. My buddies girlfriend says however, that if she hasn't left him yet, and I've showed her attention and she's rejected my companionship, then I just need to stop.  Don't know what to do, or how to continue acting towards her through this trip. Any advice or anything would be much appreciated, and to help dispose of some of this stress.",relationshipadvice

1nm2wh,1nm2wh,,My girlfriend and I broke up almost exactly a week ago. It was almost a five year relationship (it started when I was a senior in highschool) after the break up I fucked up big time. I spam text her and called her and tried everything in my power to fix things. Not only did I mess up by spam text/call her I mess my mind up I almost committed suicide several times but I just couldn't do it. She found out that I tried to do this and now she hates me. Her dad grandfather and uncle all committed suicide and she thought I was just trying to kill myself to guilt her into being with me again. I'm desperate.  Very desperate I feel like my life will fall apart she was my everything even her imperfections seemed perfect to me because it made her who she was and that made her unique and made me love her. I don't really think all too much about trying to kill myself and I know it has only been a little over a week but it honestly feels like a lifetime. Today I text her from my work phone and told her I was sorry for trying to kill myself and apologized for everything I thought lead up to our break up. She text me back today and said she wanted to talk to me and say goodbye properly I asked her if I could buy her dinner one last time and we could do that and so I could apologize in person. Is this a good idea or will it just push me over the edge even further? My head is telling me not to and to just wait and see if more time will fix things but my heart feels like I need to see her and that there's a chance we could be together again. But she also told me today that she still hates me and will never forgive me. I just don't know what to do I'm confused and still very very hurt. I used to just sit and bawl my eyes out on my way home from work. I want to see her again because I'm holding onto the slim chance that maybe we can fix this. I love her so much I just don't know what to do I know I asked her to dinner but should I just cancel it? My dad thinks that I should because he said that this will just destroy me if I go and see her and he doesn't want to see me try and hurt myself. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm sorry for all the grammar mistakes but I'm on my phone and I really just don't care right now. Can someone just give me some advice please? I just want her back and for things to be normal for me to feel normal. I don't want to go on like this.,relationshipadvice

ctii062,3eub4w,GOLDMEDALSHITPOSTER,"Jenny's parents **do** need to file amended returns. You **cannot** file Head of Household if you are legally married, and this is all information the IRS has on record. They **will** receive adjustments by mail, this is something that will be flagged in the IRS's system. This is tax fraud, of course, and it's the kind you **cannot** get away with, since the filed returns will not reconcile with the IRS's information. Probability of Jenny's parents ""getting away"" with this is basically zero. It's not a matter of whether they will they have their returns adjusted, but when. This is how it works: when you file a tax return, it takes off of the data from the return, creates an XML file that follows a very specific IRS schema, and the IRS's systems compare the information on the return to the information they have. For example, copies of W2s and 1099s--the IRS received the exact copy you did, and their systems will be looking for this information to reconcile on the return. If it doesn't (e.g., you didn't include a W2), it will get flagged automatically in the system, and they will either automatically send an adjustment or an IRS personnel will look at the return before sending an adjustment/opening an audit. The reason they need to file amended returns is this is **not** a good faith error. The IRS is generally pretty forgiving when taxpayers make good faith mistakes on their return, but they bring the pain when the misreporting is obviously fraudulent. The IRS knows they are married by law, and Head of Household is a tax-advantaged filing status. So they are absolutely committing tax fraud, and in a manner in which they cannot get away with it, and they cannot explain their way out of it when they are caught, which they 100% will be. They need to file amended returns, or this is what's in their future: best case scenario, their returns will be adjusted and they will have penalties and interest to pay, as well as the tax due. Since this is not in good faith, good luck getting relief from the penalties. Worst case scenario, they face civil and/or criminal charges. If they cannot pay, they face their future withholdings being seized, and/or IRS tax levies or liens. In that case, goodbye to their credit rating as well.",legaladvice

4v8hqj,4v8hqj,MartianPotatoes,"I live a couple of houses down from the corner of a extremely busy road. Cars pull into our street at 30+ mph. Because of trees there is no way to see a car coming until it is too late. Even if the trees were gone it would still be dangerous. Literally it is just a couple seconds before a car is in sight and almost hitting us.  Throughout the night, we hear cars screeching to a stop trying to avoid bears, cars, people... You can't see anything turning on to the street. Last month a car veered into my driveway and hit our tree. Would of totaled our car if it was there.  We've kept an eye on that corner the entire time whilst backing up and have still been hit. Better yet, the person who has hit us apologizes and knows it's their fault for not taking the corner slow.   The insurance on the other hand, does not. They say it's our responsibility to make sure it's safe to go. The car parked at my home is one of parents cars which my sister borrows. I wouldn't put my car there. But unfortunately, I end up paying for the $500 deductible when the inevitable happens and my sister  pays me back over time.    There is no where else to park. We've backed up into the driveway so we could pullout faster but that's just as dangerous and just as risky.   Most of my town is part of the National Forest, so even if you own your home you aren't allowed to cut a tree down or even trim it. I know people who had a $2,000+ fine for trimming trees on their property that they owned.   We don't know what to do. It's so dangerous. My 18 month old niece is in the back of the car when my sister backs up. I refuse to park there or pull out, but my sister has no choice since she has a toddler to take places and errands to run.   What can we do? Can we even do anything at all??  Thank you.",legaladvice

7xwxg6,7xwxg6,MrWhitesWife,"Alabama.This past September my son was referred for genetic testing by his psychiatrist. We had the testing services performed by Labcorp. The employee assisting us informed that ""my share"" of the bill was going to be $94.86. I know this isn't much money, but I had never had to pay for lab tests with my insurance before. I questioned as to why I had to pay and was informed that my insurance does not cover $94.86 of the total bill. I had her double check and also asked if I would receive any other ""surprise bills"" after this. She said no, that everything else was covered. In December I received a notice that I owe $5,986. Insurance does not in fact cover this testing. Labcorp claims that the $94.86 was only an estimate and not guaranteed to be exact amount. How is that business?

5gigs1,5gigs1,NonCompete_Question,"Backstory:  (Pre-information: I own my own IT company; other guy owns his own IT company)  A guy that I had done a couple small one-off projects with contacted me back in April about helping out with a big job (Upper management and IT department were being let go and needed someone to lock them out and perform IT operations until something was decided). Reason for contacting me is my server and enterprise networking experience.  We get the company's IT back to where they can breathe easy, and then we semi-partner up to present company with a managed IT contract (we never officially signed anything saying we were a partnership). The client company signs off on a 6 month contract that has a 60-day out-clause. The contract is under his company name and we are splitting everything 50-50.   Fast forward to present and the contract is ending Jan 8. I am not comfortable with where he is taking his company or how he treats his clients (talks down to them, etc), so I am attempting to part ways with him and basically take over the client. I do want to give the client the option to present the option to me rather than show that I am trying to poach them from the other guy.  A little note on this, the client has approached me several times about working for them as an IT employee, but I don't want to give up my company and the rest of my clients. They have also commented to me about the abrasive nature of the other guy and not really liking him.   Now the guy is trying to get me to sign a non-compete, but I am apprehensive because I would like to pursue this client myself and have been putting off signing it citing ""I haven't had time to look it over"". Anyone know if I can sign this and get out of it at the drop of a hat because of the language? Or would I need to get a lawyer to get out of it?   Does the language hold up because he is trying to get me to sign, rather than my company? Or do me and my company go hand-in-hand?   I am trying to avoid raising suspicion so he can't do something stupid.   Here is the text of the agreement that he is pressuring me into signing:  ____________________________________________________ Non-Compete (Non-Disclosure Agreement)   The undersigned sub-contractor is at no time allowed to solicit current clients of HIS COMPANYs to become clients of their own. If for any reason a client of HIS COMPANY no longer wishes to continue services, then any sub-contractor of HIS COMPANY must wait a period of no less than 2 years before they are allowed to provide services for said client independently. Furthermore, any attempts to solicit business from a current HIS COMPANY client or even conversing about the possibility thereof will be considered a breach of this agreement and subject to legal action. Also, any sub-contractor that is employed by HIS COMPANY must maintain a professional attitude towards clients. He/she may only work on projects that have been cleared by the client and HIS COMPANY. Said sub-contractor understands that any and all client data is considered sensitive and is never to be used in any way other than in the client’s interest. All client data is considered confidential and is never to be shared with anyone other than cleared individuals. Sub-contractors reimbursements for projects worked on are detailed in a separate form FORM XXX. Reimbursement is dispersed once client remits payment for the project.

3jecnj,3jecnj,Mr-poopy-buthole,"This is for a Ohio residency. Our landlord is attempting to procure  $3000 from me and my former roommates over grass fines that our city supposedly posted to our house. We notified the public services; however, they claim a fine notice was sent to our landlord's house. This was approximately four months ago. It was not until two weeks after we had moved and after the fines had doubled twice that she notified us that we had been fined. She notified us that she was attempting to get the fines repealed, but fast forward a month to where we are supposed to get our deposit back. She send us the itemized bill of expenses claiming absurd cleaning expenses. We asked for official receipts and pictures; however, she is refusing to present those to us directly and in turn wants to send them to a lawyer that we are in contact with instead. The icing on the cake though is that after this occurred she notified us that she was no longer trying to get the fines repealed.  We have also subleased this past year and she has been attempting to get the first leaser to testify against us in small claims court so that he may receive his deposit back in full and in turn the rest of us lose all of our deposit.

Your job is to avoid the things that you know make you unhappy and open yourself to the possibility of being made happy in new ways -- not to find the same girl in another body.

1j0fuo,1j0fuo,,I apologize ahead of time for my horrible spelling and grammar; I'm on my phone. Hope you mates can forgive me.  So the only age range I'll give is high school just because I'm really paranoid. I went to semi-formal with a girl I really like at the end of this past school year (semi is for all grades in my school. Not that it matters.)   Once I showed up she was with her ex... So I did what any guy would do and danced with a couple of other girls and mostly just stayed with a couple of my good friends.   A little while afterwards she ended up telling me she didn't like me after all. I didn't really take it to heart because we weren't really dating she just said she wanted to go with me to semi.   After that she decided that it would be best if we stayed friends. So we texted a lot during this month.   At this point I actually still liked her but saw no way of getting her to see me as more than just a friend.  Eventually she told me that she liked someone now and she completely cut ties with her ex (I'm a really close friend of her's so she told me first.)   After asking her a couple of questions I can almost certainly say that it's either me or one of my really close friends because she said I know them and there's no one that I know that fits that description other than me and him.   So that last paragraph happened today. What do you guys think? What should I do? Do I just give up even though she's one of the only ones I seem to be able to act normal around? (I usually pretend to be different when I'm around other people but not her. I started doing it because people found me annoying when I was just being myself. She said she thinks I'm pretty funny and fun to be around.)  A couple edits were made for grammar and spelling.,relationshipadvice

We didnt rush anything, I didnt even kiss her, we spent time together at movies or around school and I thought i was the luckiest guy ever. Then on facebook i started chatting to her and was getting 1 or 2 word replies. She said nothing was wrong but when i asked her face to face she started what sounded like a genuine confession to having got caught up in everything and about how she thought we needed to get to know each other.

My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me last Friday. It's been several days, and I'm still numb, cold, and crying. I don't have friends or family that I can talk to and feel better.   We met in college. I graduated, she still has 2 years left. I don't think she broke up with me because she's seeing somebody else, but she made a ton of friends without me there and started complaining about coming over to my place (which is about a 10-15 minute walk from her dorm). I got upset, but still tried being nice. We fought a few times, and the most recent fight she ended it.  She still talked to me when I called over the past few days, and it initially helped. I thought I could get back with her, but when I talked to her today she was very clear that I was wrong. I begged, pleaded, and cried--nothing. She yelled that I'm wasting her time, and that she has to go. She hung up. When I called back, she picked up and yelled at me some more about how I won't leave her alone. Then she turned off her phone. She said I can call her after 9pm, and that we can talk once a day. She said no movies, restaurants, or hanging out.   Reddit, what do I do? Do I continue talking to her with hopes that she'll get back with me? Do I block her on my phone and never speak to her again? Something else?   What makes this really difficult is that I am starting grad school in June. Part of the reason she broke up with me is because a long-distance relationship just wouldn't work. Starting grad school in the field I'm going into means that this is the last bit of free time I have. I'm not 21, so I can't go to bars. I'm very broke and have no money.

Son gets into an argument with our daughter's boyfriend and takes out a knife as if to show D's boyfriend that he is armed. Not menacingly, but definitely looking not very stable.

I've visited sometimes and sometimes when I'm waiting outside, I talk to some of his neighbours and they tell me of his loud partying, fights during their parties, garbage on other people's property, and communal property damage. He broke a window in the common room and an elderly man down the hall told me that my son and his friends would purposely park underneath his window and turn up their stereo after midnight.  I should add that I always try to talk to my son and get him help. My husband is more ""neutral"". Our son either just does not listen or just blocks all contact with us.  Incident 3: Son's friend's parents wants our son to move out but are willing to allow our son to stay as long as he removes his gun. Son now takes his rage out on them. This is where our son might have some mental issues: whenever the parents are visiting, our son would go out and park his car so close to their car that they wouldn't be able to open their door; he constantly makes rude remarks to the mother; as son's roommate was packing, son would take things out of the boxes and throw it in the garbage and stand in front of the garbage bin to block friend/friend's parents from retrieving, in front of everyone; and as their son was moving out, he would keep body blocking the father holding boxes walking to the car.   Incident 4: Son moves in with cousin, now they both live in a strata building. Same issues: noise, property damage, violating rules. Cousin says that they have found several communal property items in the garbage bins.  I don't think this is immaturity. Our son is 21. He has held a job before. **Considering that I've seen so many of his mental lapses, even as his mother, it seems like he really enjoys violating rules and particularly property damage, and he really enjoys bullying others.** The few times he's visited us in our house, the simplest things like asking him to lock the door, he would not do. I would walk to our door to lock it, he would come after me and unlock it and smile at me.   I know a lot of his issues does not necessarily imply he is dangerous with a gun but he has a lot of mental issues. Son keeps saying he likes to be the bully and other really incoherent things. Husband does not want him to get tested and is on his side. **Our daughter's boyfriend was the only one who stood up to him over property damage and repairs and my son pulls out a gun.**  **Is there a way we can get his gun taken away? Counselling?**  **TL;DR: Son has mental issues, continuous property damage, and owns a gun. I want to help him but husband is more neutral. We are in British Columbia, Canada.**",legaladvice

kif4e,kif4e,murramerr,"First off, I care about my partner's happiness. I don't think I can bring myself to say I love him, but I definitely like him a lot and can't just drop him.  I am young and aware that I am still learning. This is my longest relationship yet at roughly a year. However, the following has been wearing me down:  * I get snarky and cold with him every month or so. No matter what I tell myself I'll do next time, I take everything he says in the worst possible way.  (I'm not female, so it's definitely not PMS.) This usually follows a well-trodden routine: I get cold, he gets sad, I get sad, we both agree to fix a few things that were never really problems and try this again.  * He's in a bad situation. His home life is very taxing on him and he has to vent to someone, so he rants to me as an outlet. I was fine and caring at first. Now, I've started to simply offer more serious, cold advice toward making it stop than caring and happy condolences. I'm just finding it harder and harder to deal with the frequent troubles- and all he seems to do most of the time is wallow in self-pity and dismiss my advice and ideas as impossible.  * It's just not fun. In my eyes, my lover should be like my best friend. When I'm with him it's not totally boring, but not totally great either. I can't talk to him for hours without seeking other entertainment. He's really a lot like me, and this makes for undynamic and predictable conversations. (Maybe that's the problem, I should be going for opposites attract?)  Anyway, for the reasons stated above I feel tired and exhausted by this ongoing relationship. He has even less friends than me, and they tend to lie to him and leave him out of fun stuff because he's gay. (He's not even flamboyant, he's just a normal guy and means well.) So he needs me for companionship and venting and affection.  Worst of all, he says he loves me indefinitely. This makes me feel extremely guilty because I can't reciprocate, and when he tells me it's okay if I can't love him back I feel even worse- because he's just such a kind, good guy and I feel like I should be able to reciprocate.  I would like very much for us to just be casual friends, but I don't want to hurt him- and we're in the same classes, so it could be hard for him to adjust his level of affection to a more breathable amount.

The truth is that I was gone all day due to her. I get up as early as 5 am and never come home until 9, 10, or after midnight. I pay my weekly rent on time or early. I pay a little extra for a security deposit until late March. Anyway, she claims the money I made for that week or half of it as her ""money"" because of rent. She text me on morning to ask for rent that morning so she can fill her prescription. I told her no, and she had a hissie fit. She said I was lying and being greedy as heck. I told her I don't get paid until later that night and which I paid her. Two weeks later, she called me asking for more money along with rent. I told her I can't and she had a temper tantrum because of it. So, I gave her $25 to shut her up. It was a bad move. A week after that, she asked  to pick up a pack of cigarettes that my store sells. I told her honestly, I had enough money for food. She, then, told me it was a test and I fail and I got 30 days on from that Friday to move out. Then I was forced to pay her for that week. On May 31. 2015, I got accepted at a place in the campus area. I was so happy. I called my mom, my best friend and the soon-to-be ex. The roommate wasn't happy. She said that I have to stay with her for the 30 days and give the month's rent to her. (Which I didn't have.) we had this huge argument where she did all the talking and threaten to have me arrested for trying to help her. I told her to shut up and kicked me out and call the police. I went to the police station to get help and I got enough stuff for a week. After I settled in, I tried to get my stuff back, but she was out all the time.

If you are experiencing love for the first time, it is a common reaction to push it away.  Also, you two are in a tempory long distance relationship. When your partner isnt there in person to talk to and hold, its easy to forget what drew you to the person in the first place.  My advice? You've been in it for 18 months. Thats not a short amount of time, so give the relationship a chance to succeed. Talk to her about it, so that you can try to repair the situaqtion. Be gentle though, her feelings will be hurt even if you don't break up.  Also, stop avoiding her texts. I had an ex do that before he broke up with me, and it's hell.

38dc9o,38dc9o,Franks_wild_tears,"First time post; please let me know if there's a better sub for this question.  My ex and I have been divorced for a little over a year now, and we are about to enter mediation for adjustments to child care costs (we have 2 kids, both home more for the summer).  About a month ago, I received an email from my ex telling me that, because the kids are out of school for the summer, she'll need more money for child care. She outlined what she believes the costs to be, without any supported documentation. We've been going back and forth now this last month basically with me telling her that it would be best to contact child support and recovery and ask to have the adjustments made there. She refuses or ignores that suggestion. Now we're about to enter mediation.  As with a lot of couples, money was one of the most contentious issues in our marriage. Towards the end of our marriage, she basically shut me out and wouldn't talk to me about any aspect of a. our relationship, b. the children, happy to live her new life with her new boyfriend, etc. Now things are looking tough for her as she lost a part time teaching gig (she still has her own business and a rental property as income), and she's feeling the pinch.  Anyway, I have no problem with adjusting payments for my children, it's just, as I've been coping with the divorce and learning to be on my own, I want to create a boundary with her with the hope that she understands is no longer acceptable to cross. Hence, having the state process and calculate payments.   I guess my understanding of the law is that she can make adjustments through CS&amp;R without involving me. Am I mistaken in this?   Some additional information:  In our divorce decree, there is a clause to revisit child care 6 months after the divorce is finalized. We are to try mediation before going to court. I guess this is where my confusion is. We've already got a divorce decree (which, according to the person I spoke with at CS&amp;R, is considered a 'court order') that outlines the payment percentages, etc. From my understanding, we shouldn't have to deal with each other at all regarding these numbers. To me it would make sense if the percentages of contributions changed, but to make an adjustment like this should be fairly straightforward.   We are going in to mediation, but I still believe that it is unnecessary as she could start the adjustment request herself. We're just recalculating the numbers, which - as I understand it - is exactly what CS&amp;R would do. I've changed jobs since the divorce, but from the reading I've done on the state's website, that is also something that can be accounted for in child support and recovery. I think that she would like that I pay more over the summer months, and I would prefer that she budget properly and the payments are averaged out over the year (which looks to be typical according to the county's website).  I guess I'm just looking to understand what the typical process is for adjusting child care costs within a divorce decree. Would the couple typically agree on it on their own, then send in an updated decree, or would it be more likely that things get adjusted through the state. Let me know if there's any additional information that can help clarify and thank you!",legaladvice
gphfm,gphfm,,"I only have less than ten minutes to get this shit down, Reddit, and I've been thinking about it for a month, so let's shake, rattle and roll.  A month or so ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months. It was hard. I thought it was going to be hard for a long time, that I wouldn't want any body else for a long time, but at the end of that week, at a dance, I was approached by a girl who I'd always thought was the classiest girl I'd ever met. She smiled, and said ""Take me away,"" and I did.  She explained to me that she didn't want to be a rebound. I didn't want that either, but my friends were split right down the middle. Many knew her; those were mostly the ones who thought we should get together immediately, and it was hard to disagree with them. Many more besides, however, earnestly informed me that it was far too soon, and I had difficulty disagreeing with them, too. My compromise was to wait two weeks, see how it went, and if everything panned out, we would start taking it very, VERY slowly together. I told her about this plan of mine.  Two weeks passed slowly, and very, very happily. I found myself thinking about her during most of my down time, and during time spent working and studying as well. We spent time together, making a point of getting to know each other as well as we could. I learned that she is a triplet, that she loves Oreos, that she is a passionate Nordic skiier, and most importantly that she has had issues that require the most delicate handling.   The long and short of it is that I did not do that. Two weeks passed, and I could tell something was wrong with her. She confessed that she did not feel entirely ready; her past continued to haunt her, and I did my best to understand that night and send her on her way as affably as I could. I was very upset for much of the next day, and tried to go and see her again that night--however, she was gone. I assumed she was out getting drunk, and this angered me...I sent her a text message. A horribly out-of-place offensive text message that I will regret until the day I die.  The entire weekend I was an overbearing, pathetic mess. I've felt the consequences of my actions with every step I take this week, just waiting for her to give me a chance to talk to her and explain my actions.  And now, she has. Tonight we're going to talk. I'm going to go to her room with an unopened thing of Oreos, and we're going to talk this out. I'm going to do my best to explain the deep shame I feel for how I've behaved, and then attempt to express my wish to be there for her and just to help her recover, as a friend. I will try my utmost not to mention how much more than that I feel for her.  I do not know if she still feels the same for me. I can only hope she does.

In our student living arrangement, there are two separate leases for each room. Bianca has a girlfriend that lives with her, but is not on the lease. Her name is Monique. I have my own apartment, but I stayed most of the time with my partner. &gt;  &gt; The other night the four of us had our first confrontation ever, and it ended up like this: Monique threatened to kill me, beat my partner, and beat my dog if either of us ever talked to her again. Again, we all live together, so that would be impossible to avoid. The neighbors ended up calling the police because her screaming, stomping, and banging was so loud. We moved out over night into my place, and learned that Monique is a multiple time felon. &gt;  &gt; I don't want to press charges, because I just want to put this in the past, and honestly, I'm afraid they'll come after me if I do. The only thing my partner and I want is for her to be able to terminate the lease. We feel that subleasing isn't an option, because Bianca and Monique will be on their worst behavior to scare away anyone who is interested in taking the place.  &gt;  &gt; I am in contact with their previous roommate from the same apartment complex, who they threatened to hurt as well.

Is that true? Do we have no chance of getting out of this horrible, unsafe, threatening situation? We're at my apartment for now, but we can't stay for long.

My wife and I went inside, the friend stayed in the car. When we returned to the car, we saw that a driver had collided with our parked car. We exchanged insurance information, and we thought the situation was resolved.  &gt;  &gt;    However, the other driver told his insurance company he wasn't admitting or denying fault. The insurance company saw pictures of his unscathed truck, our damaged bumper, and even went as far as to request and review camera footage from the store. The security footage came back as inconclusive. That paired with their client (customer?) denial to admit fault lead his insurance company refusing to pay.  &gt;  &gt;    Long story short, our insurance company said for them to cover the damage, we would have to file it as a hit and run and we need to cover the deductible. It wasn't a hit and run though, and I don't want to falsify the account. My wife wants him to pay for the full damage out of pocket, I want him to pay the deductible.

8f8tdo,8f8tdo,,"Hello friends!  Quite a story here, but I'll provide as much information as I can. Would love to hear thoughts on how to proceed.  I've been living in a Townhouse in Queens for about six years. Each of the apartments in the house have three bedrooms, and I've had two roommates living with me during my time here.  When I moved here six years ago, I lived on the third floor of the house, about four years later, the tenants on the first floor had left and the landlord at the time asked if I wanted to take the first floor apartment, to which I obliged. During my time there, I was constantly bugged by the noise from the floors and walking above, coupled with the master bedroom being literally beside the driveway - the LL at the time was a private livery driver and made frequent in/outs in his SUV.  I dealt with the noise seeing as how there wasn't much I could do about it. A few months later, it turns out that my landlord sold the house to a new owner, without telling us. One day, I was just walking into my entryway and encountered the new LL and introduced myself, made brief talk and said hello. Before this, I was in talks with the previous LL to move back up to the third floor, as it was more quiet, and had much more space, due to the first floor livingroom being chopped in half due to the house entryway taking up that space.  Wanting to move on this opportunity since the third floor was still vacant, I approached the new LL and asked if we could possibly move up to the third floor, to which he initially said ""no"", in a very vocally rude manner and seemed confrontational, so I just dropped the discussion with him. I placed a call to my previous landlord and explained to him that I was frustrated that he didn't let me know that the house was being sold, that I had no way of obtaining the nice apartment upstairs, and I would've made a decision to move earlier if I knew that the dwelling would be under new ownership. I believe afterward, the previous LL called the new owner and explained to him that I was a great tenant, never a day late with rent, wanted that apartment for a long time, and that he should give it to me or risk the possibility of us moving closer to the train stations in my area, losing us as tenants.  The next day, I receive a call from the new LL wanting to have a discussion. Long story short, he says that he would give us the new apartment under the condition that he no longer paid any of the heat/gas/hot water and placed it in my name. I said yes, and we moved forward with a lease agreement.  Fast forward a month later, I move upstairs with my roommate. I live with my younger brother, and had another roommate, who was a larger guy, whose footsteps would constantly bug the new LL, who lives below us. On multiple occasions, our new LL banged on our door, demanding that my roommate lighten his footsteps. My roommate explained that the floors are thin wood, and that the floors in certain areas dip, and are weak and creaky. We don't make noise, but the new LL consistently complained of disruption from normal walking/living. The new LL went so far as to carpet our all wood hallway to mitigate the noise, but the floors are structurally weak, so it doesn't really do much.  In the months following, the new LL has personally come up to the home, banging on the door, demanding that we stop making noise. He has done this with our family in the home, including sending me texts asking ""who's in the house and what's with the noise"". I explained that my roommate's family is here due to an issue with flooding at JFK and having no flights to get home.   Shortly afterward, my roommate gives notice that he is leaving. The roommate asks the new LL about the security deposit and how to go about him receiving it back, because the home was purchased from the previous LL, my roommate was worried that he wouldn't return his portion of the deposit.   Come end of last month, my roommate leaves, due to issues with the new LL constantly badgering us about walking in the home. The new LL returned his portion of the security deposit and he moved out.  In the last month, I've had family and my girlfriend over on the weekends. On multiple occasions, the LL continued to bang at our door, and as of the most recent incident, at 12:45AM, to tell us to stop making noise. He proceeds to say that my ""company' (only my gf home and brother) at the time, is being loud. We have a discussion with him in the hallway and me at my door, with me explaining to him that he is directly accusing ""my company"", aka, my gf, of making noise in the bedroom.  I explain to him that there's only three people in the house, and that ""my company', is my gf, and that we've been unable to walk around our apartment because my friends and family are afraid to come over because the new LL, on multiple occasions, disrupted our household for noise out of our control and that I don't feel comfortable. I invited him to look at the floors and see for himself that the noise isn't mitigable, the following day, he stopped by to see for himself that the floors just creak, that it isn't anything we're doing.  With all of the constant interruption from the landlord, I decided that I would move out on the 15th of this month (April), proceeded to call him and gave him two weeks and explained to him that him harassing me after hours, and constantly badgering us made everyone in my home unsafe, and uncomfortable, to which he exploded in anger, blaming me for ""messing with his business"", and that ""he has a mortgage to pay"".   He arrived at the home after this phone call, angry and upset, explaining to his wife downstairs the situation, which we could all hear through the floor and walls. He calls again to ask ""are you sure you will be out of here at the end of the month, and I say ""yes"".  We arrive at today, I call the landlord to settle everything up, my rent already paid and stuff being packed up. I ask the new LL ""how do we settle the air conditioning units you told me to leave downstairs (which are mine), and how do you generally disburse the security deposit?"" He says ""we have to talk about that and wait until my wife gets home""  I wait about an hour and a half and the new LL and his wife knock at the door, I allow them entry, bring my brother into the livingroom to be apart of the conversation, and as a witness. The new LL says that ""i'm shady"", and that I'm causing him problems. I explain that nobody is comfortable in my apartment, I can't have company because footsteps make noise and I can't do anything here without upsetting them below. His wife enters the conversation with a guilt trip conversation explaining that ""they painted the house for us and that we told them we were quiet people"", to which I replied ""Yes, we are, and me walking around my house, or being up at 2AM in a master bedroom with a bathroom and me walking around it in is unavoidable"". The wife, not the new LL, says that she will give half of my deposit back, to which I asked ""you gave my roommate his deposit back, and you shouldn't have done that, because the lease clearly states that ""all tenants must be out before any deposits are returned"". I said I wouldn't take half of my deposit back and there's no grounds for holding it, and he himself performed actions that the lease didn't allow. After they (new LL and his wife) raise their voices and get more aggressive with me, I say I'm not comfortable and that I'm going to call the police to get more information, after which the wife says ""let him call the police, nobody threatens me, you're not getting your deposit back!"", and they leave the apartment.  I know the police will not issue a report if there was no physical violence, but I was under duress and figured they would know the best people to call right away to address the situation. After a talk with two very nice officers, they refer me to Queens housing court to settle the differences.  --  This is where I have questions.  As explained above, the new LL, has been harassing us and my roommate with people in the home. We aren't comfortable, we can't walk around the house, I never have my speaker volume above 15, don't use my televisions, or even play music anymore. I'm literally nervous to do anything to incite the landlord and have him come upstairs to be confrontational like he usually is. This is why I told him I was leaving.  The terms of my lease state that ""Security deposit is held by landlord as protection against physical damage to the apartment"". This apartment is the same way we received it, practically new.  In addition, the lease states ""Owner will not refund any parts of a security deposit until the apartment is vacated by all residents and/or leaseholders"".  In doing research on NY rental law, the New York AG's website states ""RENT SECURITY PAYMENTS TO FORMER OWNERS If the building is sold, the landlord must transfer all security deposits to the new owner within five days, or return the security deposits to the tenants. Landlords must notify the tenants, by registered or certified mail, of the name and address of the new owner. "" https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/bureaus/consumer_fraud/rent_security.pdf  I never received notice from the previous owner, via any form of mail, that the building had been sold at the time.  In essence, I'm dealing with a problematic landlord, who is giving us just as much crap about moving away, as he has been doing with regards to unavoidable noise.  --  I move out at the end of this month, so that is when I should be expecting to receive my deposit back, but as stated above, he already said that he refuses to give it back to me.  Is there a specific way I should approach this considering that all of these interruptions aren't actionable via police since no violence occurred? Given the circumstances above, and him returning portions of the lease to my prior roommate, does this null the lease agreement?  I've already filed a complaint with the AG via form online.  Any ideas would help! Thank you so much if you've made it this far, I appreciate it.",legaladvice

1n94hs,1n94hs,,"Not quite a relationship question, but close enough... I also apologise for a lengthy read. :(  I have had a few disagreements with my housemate (we live together in a 5-share house) over the past few weeks. He has had problems with how things in the house were run, so I did the diplomatic thing and had a (number of) talks to him regarding those. These included petty things such as turning lights off in common areas (none of the housemates, including himself are affected by them being on - the campus we live on provides free amenities), or personal issues with people (Housemate X is leaving his dishes for too long, Housemate Y is leaving his cooked food on the counters), so I called a house meeting. We discussed all points and made a set of rules (After which the problematic housemate left for a personal engagement with his girlfriend's parents, even after me telling him to stay until the rules were typed and printed) and hung them on the fridge. After the housemate returned, he proceeded to remove the set of rules from the fridge, and I printed more copies and replaced the list.  The Housemate being discussed them later came to my door and loudly complained about the rules being on the fridge without being signed, them being typed up and on the fridge without him being present, generally making himself look important and my life miserable. I proceeded to call the other house mates to another quick meeting, signed the rules (none but the one in question cared at all, me included) and hung them back on the fridge, where they stayed.  Some of the 'rules' were not in favour of this Housemate, such as his quarrel with the lights being left on - not one other housemate cared at all, so the point was dismissed. Recently he (and his girlfriend, as I only just found out last night - who also doesn't live in the house, just practically shares the room with him because she hates the unit she lives in) had taken to editing that particular rule with a pencil (after, as written above, insisting on having the rules signed so that he was sure they had not been edited). My counter was to simply remove the edited part with an eraser - until they today made the edit permanent with marker. Since the point was dismissed in the house meeting I simply removed the entire edited rule by covering it in black marker (admittedly, I was also angry/exasperated and simply fed up with their behaviour). I just came back to the list to find a very snide note written on it - pic: http://imgur.com/3y7caZ4    Is there anything that can be done? I'm already planning on moving out, but that has to wait until December... :(  I also have to add that I have had a few recent anger-fuelled exchanges with him about how he is going out of his way to annoy the rest of the household (or just me, I know I'm sufficiently angry). I have also taken to annoying him by purposely 'forgetting' to do a number of things i.e. I don't clean up my entire mess but leave a few crumbs/scraps, open all blinds during the day (he has a strange aversion to sunlight I have noticed) and putting away dishes in a way that messes with his ""OCD"" - I think he's just trying to make himself important. Oh, I might have called his actions childish in the past (which he was, and still is) and may have taken to returning petty annoyance in a childish manner, myself.   TL;DR: Housemate is a twit, OP is sick of taking his shite.  P.S.: I know the text may be a little confusing, just ask for clarification and I'll be happy to explain further.",relationshipadvice

When I moved in I set up automatic payments every month within their portal so I could set it and forget it.  Last month I saw that no charge had hit my bank account, I logged into their portal, saw that online payments were still set up but my ""charges due"" showed a balance of $0.  I emailed management asking what's up and they told me there was a problem with the online payments system and asked me to submit a payment manually.  When I submitted the payment manually the charges due showed me as overpaying by the amount of my rent.  This month I also saw that my bank account had not been charged.  I again emailed management and they sent me a screenshot of their ledger showing that I had already paid and not to worry about it......I have not paid.  What's my course of action here?

qn5o3,qn5o3,,"Hi. 18-year old gay male here. A few days ago I started seeing this 17-year old that I seemed to really hit it off with. We went out, and honestly there was a lot of hooking up, but I really enjoyed his company regardless. He's such a sweet guy, and I did tell him that I liked him, and he said he liked me back. I know high school relationships almost never last, but I...I don't know. We were really happy spending time together.   On Saturday though, he texted me saying it'd be best if we were just friends. He has a lot more going on in his life than I do: I'm on break but going back to (boarding) school soon, he still has school during the day and has a part-time job, and he has a lot of issues at home with his brother's anger issues. He doesn't have time for a relationship and doesn't know when he will again.  He told me I'm an amazing person and I'm better than he could have ever hoped for, but it just wouldn't work. He didn't mention any possibility of the future, just ""I'm going through a pretty rough time and I don't know when it's going to get better.""  Y'know what? I agree with him. I agree that a relationship or anything serious is, at this point in time, completely impractical. Honestly, I feel like relationship-wise, we were moving too fast, and I think we were headed more towards friends with benefits than boyfriends, which isn't a bad thing in my book. I know it wouldn't work either way, though. I *know* it. But I don't care.   I feel awful about this. I've known this guy for a week, but I've been so down about losing him before anything even started. I got my hopes up too much here, and everything came crashing down around me. I've never had a real, lasting relationship before because I've been the only gay guy at my school for all four years I've been there. More than anything, I'm just fucking *lonely.* I think that's why I want this to succeed so badly. I literally have no one else until college. I just feel pathetic and alone.   I want to at least talk to him before I go back to school on Sunday. I tried texting hin today to just see how he was doing and got ignored. I don't want to be clingy but I just don't know what to do at this point. I want to know if I should try to text/call him again before leaving/what I ould say, or how I can deal with the emotions in a way that doesn't involve watching TV until I forget about him for a few hours.

1i8rm5,1i8rm5,unhealthyapproach,"Hi,  I (27/m) am falling back into my old obsessive ways.  **History** (scroll down for current situation):    When I was 14, I started having a pathological crush on girl 1. Which means, I would admire her beyond everything, I would look forward to going to school in the morning just to see her smile, etc... but I would never act upon it. It was these times when we used to hang out at the mall and I would literally look forward to nothing else but when we would leave and kiss her goodbye on the cheeks (as was our custom). And of course I would get jealous whenever she did as much as talk to someone else. When I was home I would just spend hours being miserable and imagining some fantastically unrealistic events which would bring us together. I think you get the picture.   Anyway, so that lasted around 2 years, plus even part of a year when we weren't even at the same school anymore I just spent obsessing about her. Then I had a period of confusion of ~1 year where I still was mentally bound to girl 1 but also started being interested in other girls. At some point I mostly detached from girl 1 and developed the same kind of obsession about girl 2. Again I would be super infatuated about her and an astonishing part of my life revolved around her, but I would never do something except behaving awkward around her to some degree (but then, I was a bit awkward anyway so people didn't notice much.) To date most of my former classmates including my best friends don't even know I had a crush on her.   This went on for another 3 years. In college I somehow managed to get rid of girl 2-obsession, but never really developed a healthy approach towards relationships. Sometimes I would meet a girl, start getting on good terms with her and when it was time to make a move, I would start to panic and start to compare her to girl 1 (sic) usually deciding that new girl was not worth it because in doubt I would always choose girl 1.   Over time I got over girl 1 and girl 2, I have never had a serious relationship but the dysfunctional approach to relationships was gone. G1 is actually happily married by now and I now look at her Facebook profile without thinking ""it should have been me"". When I'm interested in a girl neither G1 nor G2 even cross my mind anymore.    **current situation**   Anyway, after college I went traveling, I acquired some openness, forwardness, positive attitude, became a more fun person, acquired a bit more experience with the female gender, and thought I had made it. When I came back to start my PhD, I was all entertaining and outgoing. But this other girl who started just before me, totally disables me again. Before long, I had started building up the same unhealthy obsession about her again. It's not as bad as when I was 14, but I still get jealous when she has an entertaining conversation with someone or has fun without me. What's worse, is that I actually see that a relationship is unrealistic (among other things, she's 3 years older than me, and from what I can tell, not particularily interested in me more than in anyone else) and if she meets someone (which will likely happen during the next few years) I would want her to be happy and not stand in the way. But I obsess about her anyway. And as for my being positive and fun, it appears that I only bring the new, positive me out when I'm relaxed and unstressed. As soon as I get a little tense I go back to being so-so social, a boring conversationalist and a bit awkward. And her being around is already enough for me to not be relaxed.   So, I don't really know what to do. Help?",relationshipadvice

I feel like something would have happened in the past three months if she wanted to be anything but friends.   As a girl having been in your girl's shoes, it could make the rest of your friendship really awkward if you ask her out again. If she just wants to be friends, and you make it clear you are still romantically interested in her after 3 months of her not encouraging you or anything, she will always feel the need to be a little guarded around you, lest she accidentally give you the wrong idea (that she's now interested).   That being said, you need to determine how much your feelings for her are worth - is it a strong inclination or a passing fancy? If you really feel that you *need* to tell her the truth, that you feel strongly about her, then you should tell her now. If it works, great.

Based on what you've told me, their sporadic prior use shouldn't be a barrier to that. Because the other user never federally registered their mark, they'll have to rely on common law trademark protection once you get your mark. Trademark law in the United States does follow a first-to-use rule, so your worst case scenario is that their mark might preempt yours in their immediate geographical area (and that's very limited - we're talking cities, not states). However. your federal mark would preempt theirs anywhere else, assuming you're using it in commerce for the same type of goods.  Even better, though, it sounds like the goods you produce are different enough where there's probably no likelihood that a consumer would confuse the marks (the purpose of a trademark is to protect your brand from being mistaken for someone else's, and for that, so there needs to be a reasonable likelihood that a consumer would confuse your goods for theirs, or vice versa).

It's taken some time for him to be well again. Time, patience and effort. We have always been close since I left. We had fights yes, but we still can't help but get along. We were best friends before the relationship and our child, and we still can and will talk about anything and get along.   Fast forward to now. I am visiting for 2 weeks. He has a new girlfriend who is younger than us, the same size I used to be (I had a super fast metabolism and a tiny frame before pregnancy. I'm still thin but have 'battle scars' stretch marks, different boobs and a Caesarian scar; the obvious and normal marks of pregnancy). We're all staying in the same house. I heard them bone.  I was sitting in my bed, our son snuggled up next to me, they thought I was asleep and I heard them do it.

drg62jr,7km9sw,ATTORNEY_FOR_CATS,"&gt; Just known as the weird guy who likes to hug people for a little too long or stare at women’s breasts when they talk to him. I plan on talking to the club.  [He sounds a lot like a missing stair.](https://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html)  It also sounds like maybe this job is really important for the relative and maybe even the family at large. Perhaps this is something that can be pursued as a violation of Title VII?  Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a person ""employed by an employer"" cannot be discriminated against on the basis of sex. The courts have repeatedly welcomed cases where an employee was sexually harassed and assaulted by a co-worker, especially when the employer is aware and takes no corrective actions. When the courts consider whether behavior constitutes sexual harassment, they require that it be ""severe and pervasive."" Severity is measured from both an objective perspective and from the plaintiff's subjective perspective. (i.e. Would a reasonable person see the conduct as severe *and* did the Plaintiff see it as severe?) Pervasiveness is a matter of frequency. The court then balances the severity and pervasiveness, i.e. sexual harassment claims may be actionable where the harassment occurred once but was very severe.  Even though your daughter is underage, she should still be protected by Title VII (it appears that way in the language at least). You may consider looking for an employment attorney that will provide you with a free consultation on the matter.  *Disclaimer: I'm not a real attorney, I just play one for my cat.*  Edit: I want to emphasize that these kinds of cases often come down to the jury's opinion if it makes it to court. In addition, filing a civil action would probably be the last step in a long line of legal action. Before a lawsuit is possible, you will probably have to request corrective action by the employer to stop the sexual harassment and after that you will probably have to go through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In my opinion as a layperson, I think the simplest action here is get an attorney to write the employer a letter that lists all incidents of sexual harassment in detail and gently cautions that a failure by the employer to remedy this could constitute discrimination on the basis of sex. I think that if an employer received a letter like that, especially with the current exposure of sexual assault/harassment nationally, then the employer will probably put a lot of thought into whether it's worth keeping this guy on staff.  [See also the EEOC's page on retaliation.](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/facts-retal.cfm) Note that in reality employers may have protections under local laws that would make retaliation difficult/impossible to prove.",legaladvice

12kl9y,12kl9y,,"So, last night I was at a friends place getting quite drunk. A girl I'm interested in came over and we all started playing drinking games. It was a great time for a while but she kept on walking away to answer texts she was getting from an ex. My best friend was outside talking on the phone. Sidenote: Now, I should probably tell y'all that a couple of weeks ago while out at the bar, this best friend of mine was hitting on her kind of playfully. I never heard any of this going on right around me and wouldn't have known unless she told me. She told me he was really drunk though(we all were) and not to be mad about it, and I wasn't. Ok back to the story, this friend of mine is outside on the phone and she steps outside to talk to her ex or my friend (I don't know cause I was inside). No big deal at this point, I figured she would be back soon. I'm not sure how long she was gone but it was a good 20 min before I started to get a little upset. Another friend of mine that was inside with me noticed my mood and said he'd go outside and make sure everything was ok. He came back and said they we just talking about relationship problems (exes). At that point I should have been like ""alright, no biggie, I'll just wait for a while and talk to friends around me."" But I didn't, I went to a friend that was there and said ""let's go get some bud, cause its been a while since I've smoked and I could use it now."" So her and I leave for a bit around 25min and come back. Here's where it gets fuzzy... I remember going into my friends room with her to talk about why I was upset. We talk for a good while and then the girl I'm interested in comes in and tells me she's leaving because she doesn't want to be around the bud (she seemed upset). I just said ok and she left. Long story short, I stayed a while longer until my friend asked me to take him to his car. I woke this morning and I feel horrible about it and need advice.

c1fhevj,fezzr,talashira,"&gt;i still know that we'd be a perfect couple if she only had feelings for me  This thinking needs to cease immediately. You *would not* and *will not* be the perfect couple. She's toyed with your emotions. She's dating another guy. In no way is pursuing her an option; she's *with someone else*. She's not yours, and she's not going to be. And, to be quite honest, if you had any self-respect, you wouldn't want her to be after the way she's jerked you around.  I know that you're just in high school, and when you're that age, the people in your school and immediate surrounding area feel like the entire world, but you need to understand that there are millions upon millions of eligible women beyond your little world, and you'll discover that for yourself once you graduate.  Until then, I think you need to focus on learning to respect yourself.  Take the first step: stop talking to her, except in public situations in which it would be impolite to ignore or avoid her. Explain to her that it's something you need to do for yourself. *Stick to this.* I cannot stress that enough. It's very important that you give her a wide berth, especially in such close quarters as a high school, or you will not begin to heal.  Once you've severed contact, go for some or all of the following:  * Build yourself a work-out program and stick with it.  * Develop some hobbies that mean a lot to you. Specifically, find some clubs you can join at school.  * Gain some marketable skills (learn to build websites, fix computers, etc.).  * Find ways to make new friends outside your school. Hang out with people from other local high schools or find local clubs or social groups that meet regularly that would welcome new members.  We've all been through this, we've all gotten past it, and we've all found people we love even more. While I know it sucks to have people telling you ""You're young and you'll find someone better when you're older,"" there's a reason everyone says it: *IT'S TRUE.* Until then, you need to make learning to respect yourself more important than nursing your obsession.

B) She is not interested in an exclusive relationship.   1.

c2cfyjt,jhf5c,noINSPIRATION,"From the sound of it, it seems like you're more of a passive person than an aggressive person in terms of relationships. You're the nice guy that likes to stick around and be the best active listener and/or the friend to go to for help. Of course I can be totally wrong and making completely wrong assumptions. However assuming that I am not too far off from the mark, then I can totally understand what you mean because I am of the same type.  I have been through many of the similar situations, and I feel like someone is always going to take the girl I like away from me because I might not be aggressive enough to keep the girl. It always has given me  a hell of a hit on my head because of the insecurity issues. A lot of friends have given me some advice such as 'JUST BE MORE AGGRESSIVE' which I kind of do agree. Sometimes it does become necessary to step out of your own zone, go the extra mile and do things that will 'move her heart', such as flirting/phone calls...etc (yeah maybe I don't have a big list to put so I use etc ;(...) However do not overdo it. If you sense that the girl is not appreciating the effort, then you might need to tone down the 'chopping'. This really only works with some girls IMHO. Girl loves fun guys, but some prefer a rather calm and passive one.   On the other hand as for myself, I find it really hard for me to step out of my 'safe zone'. It is really out of my character to become aggressive in terms of flirting with a girl, and tend to always go back into being either passive or passive-aggressive. Luckily for me, it has proven its own success. The girls who do not prefer too much aggression from a guy, are usually the quieter ones. They seem to take things slower than usual and prefer that the guy becomes their close friend before they consider a relationship. That my friend, you should not have too much trouble with because it comes pretty natural when you are the 'decent nice guy' in general. It is very annoying and hard to deal with the feeling that you feel inferior to a lot of the other guys around, but have more confidence in yourself. Do what you can do with the girl to make her happy without thinking about the other guys. It never hurts to pick up a new hobby, skill, talent or do something with your friends to get your mind off of those things while you are not currently pursuing the girl.  Nonetheless, I find that whichever type of person you are, do try to do something out of your safe zone to make the girl happy. If you feel confident or comfortable enough to talk to the girl about most things, muster up some courage and confess or try to lead it into those confession/relationship talks. As for leaving a huge positive impression while you move away for college (assuming that you're going far from her), it becomes a different story because long distance relationships are literally, hell.  tl;dr : Sorry, rambled on alot, not sure if provided much help, but overall, try not to think about it too much, pick up new hobbies to get your mind off of it, **Have Confidence in Yourself** &lt;-- Seriously.",relationshipadvice

fay3u,fay3u,enkadenka,"Hello /r/relationshipadvice, I would like some input on my relationship situation.  I started going out with my girlfriend about 2 months ago. During the start of it, it was exam time so we didn't really have the opportunity to get together much. We did meet a few times but because our time was limited, we didn't. We spent christmas together and after about a week, I had to leave for Asia for about 3 weeks. Throughout the 3 weeks, I did maintain communication with her and did send messages through MSN and she did reply and all is well. After I got back, so it's been about 2 months more or less into the relationship, our communication has pretty much fallen apart. Because she goes to school in another city (about 2 hours away from where I live), I wouldn't mind to visit her but there are a few signs I think that tell me I should maybe just stop trying altogether. First, I've sent her text messages but she never responds; while she's on MSN, I do send her messages as well but they either get very prolonged responses or nothing at all. Should I take this as a hint and just pack up and move on?  Thanks.",relationshipadvice
ccktnvz,1npkvx,sara-ndipity,"oh, sweetheart. =\ you aren't being a fool at all. You've been far more understanding than so any others would be in this situation, and done all you can to be communicative. As far as I can tell, the only thing left to do is to lay it down straight- that he needs to cut the crap and be open and honest, or you will leave- and then actually do it. Do you have a friend's you can stay at for a couple days? I suspect that would be helpful. You don't deserve this, nobody does. honestly, my first instinct is to say that you need to leave his sorry ass in the dust, but I know love is never that simple.   I've been in a similar situation on a smaller scale- had an ex who did things like this- and it was really crappy in the long-run. he had a collection of dirty pics he'd gotten girls to send him, and had a secret online presence on the casual-encounters section of craigslist, even as he was in a committed relationship. I so desperately wanted to think it was ok, or that we could work it out....but at the end of the day, he was just an asshole, no amount of talking could or will change that.  I hope this isn't callous to say, but I'm worried your husband might be the same kind of person- especially based on his reactions. It's like he doesn't even respect you enough to try. =\  Best of luck...hope it woks out, whether with him or without him.",relationshipadvice

Believe me i know relationships take work and more than that, you need to be humble. i try to take responsibility for every thing i do wrong. but she seems to just be more annoyed by it. and if we were in person i could ask her to tell me whether she wants me to be perfect and never have to apologize or to be useless and never admit my mistakes, but any attempts to do that over the phone or text are futile. simiarly im not the only one at fault here, but trying to explain that delicately over text where anything i can say can be interpreted however she wants is like trying to disarm a bomb while wearing boxing gloves.

m3c96,m3c96,white_collar,"A couple months ago I met someone online (we're two gay dudes; I can confirm this, our balls touched). We instantly clicked and for two weeks we experimented with dating thing. We spent A LOT of time together hanging out, but no sex, just lots of heavy cuddling and kissing and some showering together. After a couple weeks he decided we should just be friends. He explained that his biggest hesitation is that I'm younger than him (4 years difference) and I've only been out for a year, so he thought I might be overly-promiscuous. At the time I thought, OK, I can deal with that although I was fairly bummed about it. I told him I still liked him but I agreed I wouldn't let it interfere with a friendship. In the last two weeks we've hung out again as completely platonic friends. I thought I would be able to separate my feelings from the whole thing. I was so wrong.  One night, we went to the bar and had an awesome time, both of us laughing and just having an all around good time. As soon as I got home, those feelings definitely resurfaced, but I thought back on the importance of agreeing to be a friend. I did not want my feelings for him to make him feel uncomfortable around me. Then, yesterday we hung out again, but for the whole freaking day. We ate lunch, then we went out shopping for furniture, order food in at his place and spent the night drinking wine and assembling it for his place. The whole time we were having an awesome time. We both cracked each other up, we both felt perfectly comfortable around each other. There were also a couple of those moments, you know, where its kinda silent but you feel like you should probably be kissing. I quickly put it out of my mind and just assumed he was trying to hint that it was time for me to go home (it was around midnight at this point). Later however, just as I was about to leave he asked me to help him move the furniture, both of which are a mere 30lbs and he probably could've done himself. I just though, okay, sure he wants me to help him move this furniture at 12:30 at night. Makes sense. After helping him clean up, I grabbed my stuff, put my jacket on and hugged him on the way out. On one hand I was proud of myself for keeping my emotions out of it, but soon I felt that attraction re-surfacing. When I brought this night up to my friends, first thing they said was that it was totally a date and I would be in serious denial if I thought otherwise. So I started thinking, what if by acting like such a 'bro', I gave him the impression that I was no longer interested when in fact he might still be interested in me? Maybe he's feeling the same way, fuck I dunno, I'm so torn out about this bullshit. I appreciate any help.  MY QUESTION THEN IS: Considering the risk that I might make him feel uncomfortable, should I express my lingering feelings for this guy, or is it better to keep on trucking it as a friend? Do you think his actions are those of someone still interested, or is he just looking for a gay 'buddy'?  TL;DR Still have feelings with someone I'm trying to be friends with. Might be overreading the situation, but don't wanna risk the friendship.",relationshipadvice

4l72f2,4l72f2,West_Garden,Hi. I'm 20 years old and I live in Vermont. Currently my mother is trying to evict me. I'm an adult so I realize she can but I'm trying to figure out how long I have until I have to leave.   I lived in the house since I was a minor and I pay $300/month and the internet bill is in my name. She rents the house and I guess I rent from her. It is an oral agreement.   After an argument she locked me out of the house and called the cops. They came and I packed a bag and spent the last two nights away. I came back today and there is a handwritten note on my door saying I have seven days to leave or she will start legal action.   First off I'm going to ignore the letter. If she asks about it when she is back home I'll say I never got it. She can send it certified if she would like. Secondly seven days doesn't like ample time to leave. I assume it has to be months because my mother is currently fighting being evicted from the house as well by the landlord and that has been going on for months and months. It's an eviction inside an eviction.   So I'm just wondering realistically how long I would have until I would be evicted? I was already planning on moving out by August/September but I won't have the money until then to do so.,legaladvice

I'm a good looking guy and I'm dating this girl, very very good looking, very attractive girl. We're quite different though; I like talking about politics, philosophy, music, gaming etc. while her interests are only gossip, make-up and soccer. She definitely had intimacy problems before we met, being a virgin at the age of 18, even though she's very attractive. I've verified that later in our relationship too (her having intimacy problems). This has resulted in her having very few close friends, and that she's become very dependent on me.    We started dating anyway though, because we fell in love. Now, just three months after we've started dating, she annoys me a lot just when she's talking, I feel much more attracted to other girls, I want to cancel our dates as much as possible and so on, but I'm also very fond of her at some level. I know breaking up would devastate her, but I feel like I have to do it. I can't stand the thought of dealing with the possible consequences, her friends hating on me, my friends asking all these stupid questions and so on.   We're both each others first girlfriend/boyfriend, so it's a new experience for both of us. I thought having a girlfriend would be awesome for your sexlife, but she's rarely in the mood, because she feel she can't do it, unless she has shaved her legs, taking a bath and so on. And when we're finally going at it, it's all so very slow and boring, and I feel like she feels she's doing me a favor. This has resulted in me not really getting turned on by her, only being able to get an erection one time per night, whereas I've never had troubles with having sex several times a day with other partners.  Lately she's been dealing with hemorrhoids , which is perfectly normal although a pain in the ass, but that dragged her so far down, she cried every night for two weeks, and I obviously were affected by this, I hate to see her being sad. She thought it was too embarrassing to tell me, so she kept it in for two weeks, saying she wasn't in the mood for sex all that time, instead of telling me the truth. I'm afraid if I brake up with her now, she'll think it has something to do with that, which it most definitely has not.   Just writing this down clarifies my thoughts, but how do I break it to her? She's going to be absolutely devastated, because she the only problem we have is not spending enough time together.",relationshipadvice

1ehrms,1ehrms,,"18 year old female here, currently dating a 17 year old male for almost 2 years. When we first started dating, his parents were super cool. They liked me, and I liked them. My boyfriend also has two siblings (elementary-aged brother and sister in her early 20's). Him and his sister were super close, and when I came along he voluntarily turned most his attention towards me, (I am his first love) and she became super jealous and hostile towards me. When his parents learned about her feelings of animosity towards me for ""taking her brother away"", they too became hostile. And that's how everything went on a downward spiral. They became increasingly strict with him, and on numerous occasions tried to break us up by forbidding all contact, even at school, for no good, understandable reason. So many things happened, but I want to keep this post short and get down to the point. Well, his parents know a lot of cops in the city. His Mom is part of the Police Explorers and is a security guard for local events. A very close family friend of their's is also our high school's police officer. Ever since they begun to grow a disliking towards me, I always feel watched. I had blocked them and everyone associated with them (except my boyfriend who is 100% on my side) from all social networking sites. And even though my personal accounts are set to private, they were still somehow figuring out what I was posting. They also quoted one of the personal conversations we were having on Facebook messager, almost exactly. They somehow know what we do together at school (like talking to each other in a certain hallway) and a few times have pointed out that someone saw me speeding in my car a few times. Am I being paranoid, or could they possibly be spying on me? Could the cops they know be misusing their authority to spy on an innocent teenage girl who has no criminal record? We have caught them spying on US when we are together (showing up at locations to make sure we are really there, driving past my bedroom window to make sure the light isn't on and we aren't in there), but that's understandable because it's their kid. I am not their kid, however; and I feel they have no right to spy on me. They even have admitted once to try to get a print out of our texts. We give them no reason to be suspicious, and hell, I don't even know what they are looking for myself. Both of us have never touched drugs, alcohol, or even a cigarette.

1jygqk,1jygqk,37M4FMD,"Just a little background, for perspective: I am an “older” (in  terms of the average age of the general populous of Reddit) guy, who recently became single again after a somewhat failed marriage of many years. It took a couple years to get back into the swing of things, and over the past 3-4 years I have been back in the field. My problem: I am having a really tough time advancing relationships with new women I meet. I have probably met 8-9 women (and young ladies) in the past couple of years. I seem to always try to really get to know them, quickly and detect those attributes I really like about them. Unfortunately this seems to backfire in my direction more times than not. I am really not sure if this is a blessing, or a curse, but it seems that once said partner starts to get sexually intimate with me, that’s where everything changes. I get comments, or text messages the next day, or hour, like, “Wow, that was amazing. See you tonight?”. A ton of comments and discussion on my penis size (which honestly is probably if anything a tad larger than what I guess is the going average – but seriously, who cares?). I have detected that my stamina, libido, and recovery time have been amazing for some reason over the last few years (I have no idea why – Feels like I am 19 again). This is all great, but the relationships seem to never really escalate past this. It’s sex, let’s get some food, sex, sex, send me away.

1ppk38,1ppk38,squareone1,"Here's the thing: I've started to really like this girl who's in my same class at Uni; we even get the same bus to get there.  Since I'm a bit shy, I decided to write her a song and dedicate it to her. So when I showed her the video I made of me playing and singing the song, she said it was very sweet and she loved it. So I then immediately asked her for a date, and she accepted.   Unfortunately, during the evening she sends me a FB message saying that she changed her mind, and that although she was very flattered and appreciated everything, she ""didn't feel the same way"".   The next way, however, when I asked her in person for some explanation and to give me a chance, she basically admitted that she likes me, she finds me great and doesn't want to lose me as a friend because I'm a great guy, but still she didn't want to give me that chance.   I found out on her FB profile that she very recently (maybe a week or so) broke up with her (now ex) boyfriend.   Now she doesn't even want to make eye contact with me and this hurts me a lot.   Do you think that this is the reason? That maybe she will give me that chance but now it's too soon because she's still thinking about her previous relationship? If so, how much time shall I wait, and how should I act in the meantime?",relationshipadvice

c3s44tl,pqd0r,,"Been there, done that. One of my best guy friends and I were getting really close and making all of these plans (texting all the time, calling each other almost every night), but he ended up going for someone else (I live in a different state). It completely wrecked me because I thought we had something special and now...well, I guess I was the only one who thought that.   I can only say what I did--which was took him off my facebook completely. Every time I saw pictures of him and his gf together, it completely ruined my mood and made me depressed and unproductive. I felt like I was not good enough--and now I'm coming to the realization that if he doesn't realize what a catch I am, then he doesn't deserve me anyway. :-)  It has been over 2 years since this happened, so the healing process can be longer than what you'd like. It certainly is longer than what I like, but I'm grieving it and trying to move on.   Don't beat yourself up over what you can't change. Enjoy who you are and what you like to do. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but you have to take care of your emotional health, first and foremost. And it's okay to have those feelings--you don't have to feel guilty for having them. If anything, the fact that you're not asking ""how can I break him and his girlfriend up"" illustrates that you're a good person that has a bit of integrity.

Long story short, my father passed away suddenly without a will, and now my family (me, my brother, and my mother) are in the final stages of receiving the money my father left behind.  We only need to get a probate bond (administrator's bond) for $60,000 (cash and stock only, no property), so we went to several bonding companies to ask about the price for the bond.  While applying for the bond (with the agent assisting us), we found out that it'll be almost impossible for us to get the bond without first hiring a lawyer.  Now, I understand WHY we need the lawyer (in case a family member just runs off with the money or something), but my brother and I are in agreement that we don't want any of that money.  This money was supposed to be used for my parents' retirement.  Given that we don't really need anyone to ACTUALLY administrate the money since we all just want the money to go to my mother, is it possible to get the bond without a lawyer?  We do not have much money, so would rather not spend thousands on a lawyer when all we want to do is transfer money from my late father's account to my mother's.  The agent has said that it's possible to get the bond without actually RETAINING a lawyer, but I would still need a letter of recommendation from an attorney stating that s/he will be advising me through the administration process.  The problem is, I don't know of any lawyers who would just do this for me.  Thank you for taking your time to help me out!",legaladvice
cdgzu4q,1qusze,Bakerofpie,"I was on and off with a guy for seven years. We got together really young and broke up twice, but there was at least a year between each breakup and the last time we got back together lasted over three years. In the beginning we were in love and just too young to know how to be in an actual relationship. It was great when we got a little older and figured things out. It ended up not working out eventually, and it was really hard to accept when it was finally *really* over. In short, I don't ever condone trying to change yourself for the purpose of getting someone back. If both of you make changes for yourselves then sometimes, *sometimes* it can work out.

edtlr,edtlr,whythrowawayrecycle,"We dated for about 2 years. When I was about to move away for work, she wanted to try out distance. All of my relationships have been ""distance"" in some form (closest girl lived an hour away) and I know how much it sucks, so I said no and broke it off right there. She was my deepest love and I wanted to lessen the pain of a breakup by doing it in person and not potentially over the phone as per some of my past distance relationships. Smooth, I know. Likewise, I was her strongest love and on top of that, she thought I was the one (I'm 26, she's 25). Needless to say, she did not take the breakup very well. She flew into a rage and even called me out on a dirty secret of mine - as a side note, now it's just plain awkward to know she knew for a while, and will always know. Is there a way to get over that?  Back on topic. A few weeks pass and she starts contacting me out of the blue. Some of them were drunken rage texts and calls but most were just shooting the breeze. I still loved her so I would return texts and pick up drunk rage dials. Maybe she still loved me. Eventually we rekindle some sort of a friendship, even going as far as her saying to me ""Text me when you get home from the club tonight; I want to know you made it home safe. I know how much you like to drink."" Apparently this was too far because a few days later, she calls and starts to ask about ""us"" and our future. I say I would greatly enjoy having her as a friend. Long story short, she again wanted to try distance, I said no, she said ""I'm your girlfriend or nothing at all. I can't be happy just being your friend"", I said ok, looks like we can't even be friends. And that was that.   It's coming up on close to a year later now. We blocked each other on Facebook and hit the gym so I have no clue what she's been up to, save for one drunken night I was looking at pictures and knowingly clicked into some of her where she wasn't tagged - she looks great. :/ We will undoubtedly see each other at an ""engagement party"" early next year. Back when we were dating, a mutual friend invited both of us to a party 2 years in advance where he would propose to his girlfriend, coinciding with her finishing grad school after this current semester. We both agreed. We can't really back out now since this couple is great friends and we (individually) want to celebrate their moment together.   I've never been in this situation before. In the past, when I broke up with a girl, she was likely in a different town or state so there was a low probability of seeing her again. This time around, there's a low probability of *not* seeing her. I have a few assumptions of what will happen: she will glare at me, her friends will glare at me, and if there's any sort of near-range activity like standing in the same buffet line, one might be able to cut the tension with a knife.   Is there any way to make this not as awkward? Should I contact her and start some friendly chit chat a few weeks before, just so we're on somewhat decent talking terms going into the party? Do I smile when I see her, or be indifferent, or pretend I don't know her, or what? Etc.  One thing my friends ask when I talk to them about it is ""What are your current feelings for her?"" To be honest, even after a year, I still have some feelings for her. I can't shake off what we built up just yet. Emotions aside, I consider (or want to consider) her a friend. During our ""second"" breakup, I told her that if she ever called me either on accident or on purpose, I would still pick up... to which she replied ""I would never fucking call you."" Basically, I'm going in with an open mind. If she wants to talk, I'll talk. If not, that's cool. I just want our side situation relatively under control so we don't spoil the big reason for the party.   And that's another thing. Since we've had no contact, I don't actually know if she still hates me. Maybe she does, and has aired my dirty laundry out to all her friends. Maybe she doesn't, and is indifferent. Maybe she's on her version of reddit writing the same post right now. Can't tell, and that adds to the confusion.   Halp.",relationshipadvice

We started things as an agreed non committed situation with no disclosure required. I'd been seeing someone else causally, but ended it when boyfriend and I decided to be friends with benefits. During this time, boyfriend found a condom wrapper that wasn't his. Out of embarrassment and wanting to spare his feelings, and having honestly no expectations of a serious relationship forming, I lied and claimed it must have fallen there during my move, and that I'd not been with anyone else in my apartment. It was fucked up and pointless and I realize that now as much as I did then.      Fast forward to last night. In the interest of openness and honesty I brought up the other guy and the short span of time between the relationships. He put two and two together and realized the lie I'd told, and no longer feels he can trust me enough to be in a relationship. He's promised himself in the past that he will not tolerate dishonesty from a partner. He wants to be friends after taking some time to cool down.      I know I fucked up.

ccrjcb2,1ofo49,pottersquash,"**Found it!**    LA Civil Code 2520, Chapter 9: Redhibition   Warranty against redhibitory defects  The seller warrants the buyer against redhibitory defects, or vices, in the thing sold.  A defect is redhibitory when it renders the thing useless, or its use so inconvenient that it must be presumed that a buyer would not have bought the thing had he known of the defect.  The existence of such a defect gives a buyer the right to obtain rescission of the sale.  A defect is redhibitory also when, without rendering the thing totally useless, it diminishes its usefulness or its value so that it must be presumed that a buyer would still have bought it but for a lesser price.  The existence of such a defect limits the right of a buyer to a reduction of the price.  Your problem is Art. 2551:   Defects that are made known to the buyer or that are apparent  The seller owes no warranty for defects in the thing that were known to the buyer at the time of the sale, or for defects that should have been discovered by a reasonably prudent buyer of such things.   Now, if you read further (and you should, its fun!) [You will see you are not so entitled to a refund first but seller is entitled to make a repair](http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=109572&amp;showback=) Given that, your first step is to make your issues known in writing to the seller.

13mngs,13mngs,,"Help  Hey reddit, I'm an extremely closed person and I feel somewhat strange doing this, but my chest is about to explode so I though that this would be a better way to let off some of the pressure. For some reason I just can't talk about my feelings to anyone in person, is just something that my mind won't allow me to do and even when I decide that I'm going to, I feel silly and don't say anything at the end.  The problem is, I can't freaking handle it anymore, I'm a 20 years old male who has not been in a single meaningful relationship in his whole life, I have had a total of 1 girlfriend, which lasted 1 month and it was really just some stupid teenage game. and it wouldn't be a problem, if every single girl my stupid self decides to fall in love with would stop seeing me as nothing more than a friend.  The first girl I ever fell in love with, 11th grade of high school, seems to have started a chain of disasters in my love life. She was this cute girl that had entered to my school recently and came sat beside me and started talking to me the first days of the school year. Unfortunately, I am a fall in love too-hard too-fast kind of guy, so after the first week I started trying to talk to her more often to see where things could reach. I told my friend about her, and how I really liked her, biggest mistake of my life. My friend was always one of those guys who needed recognition from others, and in order to obtain this, he decided he would make that girl fall in love with him, well, he succeeded, and for the longest 3 months this girl who I fell in love with would come to me and ask me for my phone so she could message my friend in class, being perfectly aware of my feelings for her, she would just do it to fuck with me as I was later told, so those were 2 simultaneous stabs in the back that until now are still healing.  They broke up, we became ""friends"" again, I fell for another girl, he did it again.  What hurts me the most is that when I love someone, I do so genuinely, for some reason all I can think about is that person, now even to me this sounds like low self-esteem issues, but I am not a bad looking person and have been told by 3rd parties for most of the girls I get to like that we'd make a ""cute couple"" which only makes it completely worst.  Fast forward a couple of other stories (which I won't talk about since it'd make this extremely long and even more depressing than it already is) to the present, I have moved to London for college in the search of a more fulfilling life, I get to know this girl which I really get to like, and I let her know about it sending obvious signals. I invite her yesterday to a party and we go for it, I keep on trying to be flirty with her, without getting to the annoying line of course, and she responds well, and while walking to this party she puts her arm around me and my heart instantaneously starts jumping, we finally got the girl we liked. False alarm, there were to guys running towards us and as soon as they passed by us she took her arm off me and started walking like nothing happened again. We get to the club, party alcohol fun, I keep on dancing with her the whole time, kiss her in the forehead, she meets another guys, starts making out with him, leaves with him.  Now not only do I walk back home alone, I do so with the purse that this girl had left in the club(we live in the same dorms). I have always lived by the words ""be the better person"", So I decided that I would just move on, not blaming her for anything, is not her fault that she doesn't like me the way that I like her. Today I see her, give her purse and walk to class with her(I wasn't going to class, but it was raining, I had an umbrella and the though of sharing an it with her...) telling myself that I should restrain myself from trying to get this girl,but she just won't leave my thoughts even after all this bullshit.  I am extremely depressed at the moment, what I'm I doing wrong? Why can't we choose who we fall in love with? Why do I care so much? Why can't I tell them to fuck themselves instead of still trying to be a fucking gentleman? Why do they still stay around me even after I've made my intentions clear?. I wish I could just switch off my emotions, I feel like they're pranking me, seeing how bad can I get before I snap.

caff4pj,1fztqk,Ally_nitro,"Well first, you should talk to her and see if she will talk some sense into her parents. If that does not work then, legally she can move out without their consent. The thing with that is, though, she needs to be the one that wants to move out. Don't try to force her to choose between you or her parents because, even though you've been dating for quite some time, she may be too scared to move out and you may be left heartbroken. So DO NOT make her choose between you and her parents.  Also, you all need to have the finances to be able to afford it. I would only suggest moving out as a last resort though. See if she can talk to her parents and make them understand that she is 18. If they keep y'all under heavy surveillance all the time, then eventually she will resent her parents and when she decides to leave, it won't be on good terms with her parents. If the talking thing works, it may take some time for the parents to adjust so give that some time! Hope everything ends up ok!",relationshipadvice
3y15cw,3y15cw,southwestthrowaway,"A couple of months ago, my wife rear-ended a vehicle--the accident was her fault; she was following too closely.  The damage to the vehicle she hit was negligible. The driver told her to not even worry about it. This was a work vehicle and already pretty beaten up. Her car, on the other hand, needed some fixing.  In the month prior, we had switched insurances and didn't want to start off with a claim. So, at the scene of the accident, she told the other driver that she'd take care of her car out of pocket. She didn't have the new cards for her policy yet, so she gave him her old information and phone number, and they parted ways.  Fast-forward a month or so. I've already paid several thousand to fix the front-end of her car. We get a claim denial on the previous policy in the mail, since it had already been canceled. She calls the other driver to ask why he filed a claim anyway. He mentions there was some damage after all, and it'll be a few hundred dollars to fix. She asks him to send an estimate from a body shop.  She hears nothing for several weeks. Then today, she gets a call from the other driver telling her the damage adds up to $x,xxx, but he'll take $x,xxx minus $xxx to settle the deal. She repeats that she needs an estimate from a body shop. He then admits that he has no intention of actually fixing the vehicle, but rather wants the money it would take to fix it instead.  I'm not pleased with the way this went down from the beginning (I didn't find out about it until my wife left), but she is taking responsibility for the accident. However, as this starts feeling more like extortion, I'm wondering where the money-grab ends, what her obligations are, and how best to handle the situation to resolve it.

didat59,6eug8w,DoctorToonz,"In my state (WA) the retailer is specifically allowed a 'civil restitution' amount that is equal to I think 2x the value of the stolen merchandise PLUS $200. (that amount may be more now, it's been a number of years since I was a retailer).  It's entirely civil. If the shoplifter did not respond to the letter demanding the restitution, our store would then file in small claims court. I only once had a case go to that court. All others settled prior. (a few disappeared). The one that did go was made to pay us.   We always justified the dollars to ourselves in the same way others on this sub have suggested: the cost of shoplifting is astoundingly large. WAY more than the sum of all the restitution that we ever received in our 15 years of doing this. Our average thief stole about $30 worth of goods so our average restitution amount was about $260 (+$20 for small claims filing).  One thing I might suggest is to go to the retailer and ask to mitigate the value. Perhaps they'll take half the restitution amount? Just a thought.  My question for the sub is: Since this is a civil suit, does it create some kind of 'record' for the shoplifter?

ppkex,ppkex,donttiemedown,"Throwaway account.  Sorry if this is a little long, but I want to put as much detail out there.  So I've been dating this one girl for about half a year now.  She's still in college and I've already graduated and have a job.  I am out of a long-term relationship (over 3 years) and have no desire to commit to anything monogamous; I'm basically enjoying some freedom.  However, I did meet this girl and we get long pretty well.  For me, it's like we're really great friends who cuddle and occasionally have sex.  For her, it's more like she wants me all to herself.  She knows I date other women but she says the idea of me having sex with other women disgusts her.  We have a few rules in place (like how I should clean up before she visits) but she finds out that someone else was over and then just goes out on a crying spree because she's ""afraid of being replaced.""  I've made it quite clear that I'm not ready for a committed relationship anytime soon, but sometimes I feel like she's just waiting around until I am ready, which I feel isn't right.  To me, it really feels like she's just putting up with it for some kind of payout at the end.  She says things like ""if we break up, then I'm going to feel like I just wasted all this time.""  I try to tell her that if we're enjoying ourselves now then it's not time wasted but she doesn't seem to approve of that logic.  She tells me that she's miserable but when I suggest that if she's that miserable that we should just stop seeing each other, she says she'd rather be miserable with me than alone.  She's totally free to date other men, which she has tried but for some reason she just attracts complete losers and then gives up immediately.  Also she says things like ""I don't want to date other men"" which sounds a whole lot like ""I only want you.""  She's really insecure (she used to be ""heavy""), a huge pessimist, and has had some really terrible boyfriends in the past.  By comparison I'm a happy-go-lucky optimist.  We kind of want this to work out somehow without me having to be in a committed relationship and without her having to feel like she's competing with other people I'm dating.",relationshipadvice

16t283,16t283,,"So I just gave my son up for adoption. This past week. It is an open adoption, so he isn't gone from my life, but had I been in the relationship I thought I was in I never would have had to do that. It is honestly the hardest thing I've ever done, and I will always feel sad about it. I did the right thing- I couldn't give him the life he deserves, but I wish things would have gone differently.   This whole process has made me think more about what I want out of a relationship, and what I want is someone who wouldn't even think of leaving me in the hospital alone after I had a baby so he can play video games and jack off to ex girlfriend's Facebook pictures.   My expectations are not super high- despite what my shitty ex boyfriend would tell you. Fidelity and honesty are not things that should come only occasionally. I know what I want and I know what basic things everyone deserves out of a relationship.   I am just wondering WHERE people find these guys (and girls) who are... nice.  I'm obviously emotionally wrecked (and physically not my best), but I'm working with a counselor to help me come to terms with things. My first step is completed- I told my ex I didn't love him and asked him to leave (he lives/d with me- but has his own place, so he wasn't kicked to the curb or anything).   I'm not over him despite what a shit head he is. But I'm done with that chapter of my life. It is in my past and I've put it to rest. I'm okay being alone, and I think it is good for me right now and probably for the next few months, but I want to eventually find someone to be with. I love intimacy, and I love being in a relationship, but I don't want to find myself in another shitty one.   So where do I go? Should I just eharmony it up or something?

odnn7,odnn7,coderp,"My girlfriend and I of almost 5 years just broke up last month. The relationship had been getting bad - lots of fights, general feelings of misery on both sides, serious trust issues again, on both sides, so on, so on. We talked about it and realized that we needed to break up or we would end up completely hating each other.   During the relationship, there were plenty of things that one didn't like about the other... I can't stand most of the tv/movies and most of her music. She wasn't into technology or computers at all and it drove her a bit mad that I spend 90% of my time at the computer, even if it is working. She would interrupt me, habitually, spend way more money than she needed to when shopping, and was just kid of awkward in most social situations. Oh, and she did several thousands of dollars of damage to my car and never paid for anything. I, on the other hand, ruined a fair share of outings by getting agoraphobic, canceling at the last minute because I had to work so she went on her own, or being a bitch in traffic. We just started to ware on each other after a while.   We're still living together (she moves out on the 28th) which certainly doesn't make things easier, but, I feel like I'm losing my mind most of the time... One minute, I'm happy and talkative, the next, I'm sad and want to be left alone. I know these are common feelings, at least they're ones I've been through before with previous relationships, but they're usually a little bit easier to get over and focus on something else. I'm sure the fact that she's still here has a lot to do with it.   There's no way to say for sure how I'll feel after she moves out, but I would imagine more depression and crazy mood swings. I just hope that I can get over them instead of thinking we made the wrong decision. We both agree that we have a lot of growing up to do and it would be best if we stayed apart while doing it, which sounds good I suppose. But at the same time, isn't that kind of what people who are in long term relationships do grow together? Hell if I know, I've never been in one longer than the one I just got out of.   Does this seem like the right thing to do? If not, I'm really not sure how to go back at this point and if so, what can I do to keep myself from thinking about these things? I usually work, but even that doesn't seem to be enough to distract my mind completely. I don't go to bars, I don't like 'em, there's not a lot of people in the town I'm in, and most of my friends live down in Denver and I'm about an 1.5 hours away in the mountains.   **TL;DR** My girlfriend and I just broke up and I'm having a hell of a time deciding if it was the right thing while not letting it run my mind.

p691n,p691n,,"So I'm going to try and keep this pretty simple but still hit on everything with minimal edits.  I've been dating a girl for about a month now and things are going absolutely fantastic...outside of the bedroom.   So far we've attempted to have sex 5 times and I've only been able to stay hard twice. It really bothers her and she gets really upset because she doesn't understand what's happening and I don't either.   She's beautiful to me and I am *very* turned on by her but for some reason when she's ready for sexy time, I lose my erection.    * The first time we tried, we started out having sex just fine but when she told me to get a condom, I had to go across the room to get one and by the time I got back to her, I was loosing my erection and couldn't get it back up. I tried going down on her and jacking it but nothing worked. I was really gassy and my stomach was all kinds of upset so I used that as an excuse.   * The second time, no boner. She gave me a little head and I was starting to get hard but when she stopped, so did my penis. She ended up getting really upset and leaving my house that night. :/ * Third attempt, we were out of town and had been drinking with some of her friends. When we got back to her place we started messing around and I was able to get it up and we were having actual intercourse but then she wanted me to stop because she was drunk and wanted our first time to be perfect. No problem there.  * Fourth attempt was fantastic. It was two nights after previous attempt. We had a great time on a triple date with some of her friends. When we got back to her house and got in bed, everything was firing on all cylinders. She started out on top, wanted to switch positions and I put on a condom in transition and everything went swimmingly. Finished strong and everything. Thought I had gotten over whatever was wrong with me. * Last night, another failed attempt. We were at my house watching movies and whatever. She got in a real playful mood and was joking around biting and play fighting. At one point, she reached in my boxers and grabbed my erect dick and said ""Hello!"" but that was it. Later in the night, we started to get frisky and she went down on me for a little while (a very little while) and when she came up trying to straddle me, no dice.   I don't know what to do. I've only encountered this problem twice before and it was only on the first attempt to have sex with those girls.  I'm just worried this is going to cause issues with our otherwise perfect relationship.   I'm 23 years old so I don't think it's e.d. And I've never really had a problem like this over a period of time.   **EDIT:** So this might be absolutely stupid but I think I realized what the problem was... Thursday night last week, I spent the night with her. We ended up messing around during a movie and I fingered her, went down on her, really trying to give her some good foreplay.    She went down on me and my dick was completely flaccid. She stopped and said, ""You're not doing this to me again, are you?"" I said, ""Just keep trying. Don't freak out about it."" So she did but I was getting nothing going down there. She stopped and got mad.   As I laid there in my shame, I was trying and trying to think about what I've been doing differently since I've known her and it hit me like a ton of bricks...I have been taking some laxatives pretty regularly since I had been dating this girl. I was stopped up for a few days and was trying to really clean my system out.  The Saturday when we were out of town, I hadn't taken them for a few days...things were starting to piece together.   I grabbed my phone and did some research and apparently ingredients in some laxatives can lower your sex drive. Who knew? I went to the Walgreen's site on my phone and found the laxatives I have been taking and researched each ingredient and one of them does cause a drop in sex drive.  Before I told her this, I realized that I wasn't even catching random boners throughout the day. And hadn't masturbated but once in the three weeks or so I had been taking the laxatives.   After convincing her to hear me out, she stopped being mad and we started talking and joking around again. I told her I wanted to make it up to her and started fingering her and brought her to climax. The excitement of that and me realizing that I **think** I found the cause of my problem caused me to get hard and we had fantastic sex that night.   Unfortunately (slash fortunately) her period came on the next day so there hasn't been another chance for us to have another go at it to make sure.   Thanks for all the advice you guys!

3ydd7v,3ydd7v,maybeitsapony,"My uncle is basically driving my widowed grandmother into the ground financially. He's actively and heavily using heroin and drinking and has conned her out of over 10k of an 80k annuity she has as basically her only source of income. He's also put her bank account hundreds into the red with overdraft fees over the last 2+ years since grandpa died. The latest development is that she's put his name on her car title and let him have that, leaving her with no actual vehicle of her own although she has access to a borrowed one. My other uncle and his wife currently live in the home with her but have their own lives and generally only step in on emergencies, like paying her overdraft fees, getting the electric back on or replacing yet another stolen cell phone. They do run interference on addict uncle when they notice, but they both work and have things to do with their own kids that leave her home alone and open to manipulation all day and are honestly in denial about how bad it is.  My mother (who lives 5 hours away) and I are lost on what to do. He doesn't respond to anything we say because he knows as soon as she's alone he'll get what he wants. A police report was once filed but she defended him and it never went anywhere. She's not suffering from dementia, but cognitive decline is evident. She gets confused, doesn't hear well and does not possess the mental acuity to see what her son is doing when she's being manipulated. She buys all his lies and sob stories every time. I've been told that as long as she's still her own guardian and willingly giving him what he wants we're SOL on putting a stop to it, but I have a hard time believing that. There's a definite paper trail on the money troubles she's had with the bank, her insurance, etc. I was thinking perhaps this could count as elder abuse.   I don't want her to spend her last days in misery and poverty because of this asshole. Is there any legal ground here or are we out of luck unless he does something extreme like harm her?

ddmx0ia,5tbrew,legaladvicethrow3842,"Also consider that humans have a skewed sense of what random is. People don't understand how frequently true randomness results in events clumping together.  Flip a coin a million times. ~500,000 will go to heads or tails. Roughly half of the flips will be back to back heads, or back to back tails. A quarter of them will be runs of 3. An eight will be runs of 4. You'll have ~1950 runs of 10 identical flips in a row, and you're fairly likely to have around 2 runs of 20 in a row (your variation starts to get pretty high at this point).  If you ask a random person, they'll probably find the number of runs in the 8-15 range impossibly high because they assume that past behavior predicts future behavior, and that things need to 'even out' after a few flips. That's not the case when you are pulling names out of a hat. He very well could be getting preferentially selected, but your sample size is too small to say so for certain.

Possible Canvasing?**  Original Post:   &gt; Not sure if this is the right place to post this. &gt;  &gt; I'm a prospective university student starting this September who applied for accommodation with this specific university. &gt;  &gt; To apply you had to write a brief statement about yourself, listing your hobbies and your interests in 250 characters. &gt;  &gt; Or at least that is what the application form said. &gt;  &gt; Fast forward to yesterday, the day applications closed. I found out this character limit was a mistake, and it was actually supposed to read 250 words. This is the difference between 3 short sentences and 3 short paragraphs. It was right up to the deadline when I heard this, giving me only 40 minutes to write my application. The university did not inform me or try to inform me of their mistake. I wrote my application and emailed my new statement to the university, who assured me they added it to my application. &gt;  &gt; I found out today I was not offered a place. &gt;  &gt; My questions are: Was my application given the same deliberation as all the others? &gt; Would the university be obliged to give students with 250 characters a place? &gt; Is there anything you can think of that I can do now? &gt;  &gt; Also in the interests of transparency, I was on national news for around 30 seconds about a month ago talking about my exam results. The interviewer asked about university and specifically accommodation came up. He spoke about it and showed a clip of the campus, including the name. Could this be seen to be canvasing?  &gt;  &gt; Thank you for your help in advance     --- LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",legaladvice

knvbv,knvbv,fapsternomore,"That's the symptom. What's the cause? I can only guess, but I think it's a combination of many factors.  Early on (around 6 or 7) I learned how to make myself feel good by masturbating. Even though I physically wasn't capable of producing sperm, the sensation was still there. I remember the first time something actually came out, I was scared shitless, until my older brother told me later that it was totally normal. You could imagine my relief, and continuation now that I've been more or less given carte blanche.  For some reason, early on in my life I gravitated towards fantasizing about being dominated by women.  I was really shy and young, so I'd spend a lot of time fantasizing and fapping. Once I got a computer, things became even more intense. But instead of watching porn (which I really don't enjoy), I'd read stories about women dominating men (www.mcstories.com probably being the biggest offender).   Why I gravitated towards this type of fantasy baffles me. I didn't really have a strong mother, so I assume maybe it was overcompensating on what I perceived as mistreatment of my mother at the hands of my dad. He left when I was 11, and although I don't know even to this day how much it affected me, I'm sure it did. I guess on some level this appeases some psychological perception or desire to not get close to females. Female genitalia don't really appeal to me, and nakedness makes me... uncomfortable. I'm much more attracted to clothed women (makes sense since it doesn't remind me of my inexperience in this field).  Since I was always shy, fantasizing and constantly masturbating was an outlet that I could use to avoid becoming intimate with women, or anyone for that matter. I was very to myself; had few friends, never went to prom, or did anything really social for that matter. I've always had some unexplainable fear of women, of them being vindictive, evil or whatever. I guess not knowing much about something leads to all sorts of inaccurate perceptions. My parents splitting up and the subsequent death of my mother didn't help things much. I just became more reclusive, hedonistic and indulgent.  I became somewhat sick in my early 20s, and there was a dark time in my life between approx 23 and 25. I would just sit around all day, not doing much of anything. Eating junk food, fapping, pretty much just wasting away. Depression, apathy and confusion were my daily companions. It wasn't a mystery as to why I was sick or why I continued to be so. My family would constantly fight with me, lecture me, sometimes even bribe me. They didn't understand what was plaguing me or why I had become so self-destructive.  Some people argued I was gay, but it didn't work out that way. I AM attracted to females, but I've set up many barriers to make their attainment virtually impossible. And on some level I do have a fear of women and their sexual powers, and I've very often perceived them as being selfish, vindictive, and just downright evil.  I've considered myself ugly most of my life, and I've worked hard to maintain that image. Besides a few very short times in my life, I usually haven't taken care of myself, which led to me being constantly overweight. My father wasn't around, and my older brother was too busy with his own thing (or his intuitive explanations were always too vague for my analytical mind), so nobody really taught me how to dress right (I wore mostly hand-me-downs or had my mom dress me till I was in college), or how to interact with the opposite sex. Even now I don't really dress well, just enough to get by, holding off purchasing a new wardrobe with really nice clothes until I lose weight and ""look good."" Been waiting nine years now.  It's like I've convinced myself that I could never be with someone attractive, and once you've made that an axiom in your life, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. There have been girls who have been interested in me, girls who I look back upon from the vantage point of today and realize were nice and attractive. And yet I'd lose interest in them. Because in my world, once someone became interested in me, how could they be attractive or worth my time? If in my mind it's axiomatic that I can't get a girl who's attractive and nice, how can it be that this seemingly attractive and nice girl likes me? The only explanation must be that she's really not attractive and nice, and I've been duped this whole time. Hence I'd lose interest, much to the chagrin of these girls, who couldn't fathom my erratic and hot and cold behavior. The more they warmed up, the more distant I became.  So I've pretty much set myself up for failure. Either pine for the attractive unattainable, or settle for the perceived undesirable. Of course this is solely a problem with perception, mostly stemming from one's own self esteem. You'll never be able to get anything of value if you feel you're not worthy of it. This is more a matter of mental projection than anything mystical a la ""the secret.""    I can be very shallow, and a lot of times don't even want to associate with girls who I don't find attractive, for fear of ""being seen with them"" or some other inane excuse. Someone remarked recently that it's not something you should spend a lot of energy thinking about. Just enjoy people's company and try to find the good in them, instead of snap judging. How much more so does that apply to oneself. If you can't enjoy the company of yourself, how the fuck do you expect to enjoy the company of others? This feels like a natural consequence to having a tendency towards perfectionism.  Which leads me to myself. I know shockingly very little about the person typing this up right now. The constant apathy, negativity and repression have led me to a place where I'm not sure who I am when I look in the mirror. This is what happens when you hide yourself from the world. It's no different than someone who cheats his way through school, and constantly fools himself that he knows everything he studied, until one day it all comes toppling down and he realizes there's nothing there. Even though my age is at a place that society's barometer says you ""should have your shit together"" by (I can only imagine the collective reddit horror of reading about a 30 year-old virgin), I'm really so so far away from that. Last year I hit a bottom and I almost had a nervous breakdown due to stress at work and home and finally broke down and sought out help for myself; have been in therapy since. I picked myself up quite a bit and started exercising, taking care of myself, and whatnot. I even went about a month without fapping. It was the first time in a long time I've had such energy, clarity of thought, and just plain joy in my life. It also increased of my desire for women (and life) exponentially. Starve me for a month and I'll pretty much do anyone on the street.   This state of affairs didn't last long however.   I've been doing better but at the same time there's a lot of inner turmoil and confusion. I think the first step forward is getting out of my fantasy world and into the real world, with real people (and women!). I constantly turn to fapping when I get worked up or there's too much stress in my life, but I honestly think there's no hope in continuing to do that. I guess true wisdom and maturity is being able to delay instant gratification for something more intense and beneficial in the long-term.  It scares me to think how much of my life, time and energy I've thrown away on pointless pursuits. How much fear, uncertainty and doubt have dominated my actions, words and thoughts. How despair has been the confidante I've turned to in troublesome times. I don't want to live that life anymore. At times my resolve is strong, and at others it's a big mess. Constant perfectionism doesn't help much either, it just makes you hard on yourself and on others. I think the one thing you realize with age is that tenacity and perseverance trump almost any negative personality trait. Do something with much effort and time, and you're bound to end up in a better place. And take chances. It's ok to fall flat on your face. And it's ok if not everybody likes you.  It feels foolish that some people learn these things so late in life (or maybe  I'm wrong and it's not that late). I've gained some optimism but everything ahead seems like a big question mark. How I pick up the pieces now is a big question mark. The best I can come up with is the tried and true ""take it one step a time"". I'm not sure why I even posted this on relationshipadvice, probably belongs in /r/depression or something. I'd appreciate your thoughts anyways. Thanks in advance.",relationshipadvice

gp10d,gp10d,throwaway10321,"I'm at a loss. I'll try to keep this succinct and honest.  First some facts. My girlfriend has only been with one other guy (six year relationship) and I finally figured out from talking to her that she has never had an orgasm. She feels ""really, really good, to the point she can't handle it anymore"" and then she pulls away (from oral, the only thing that gets her going) but has never felt a sense of ""release"". She is confused by the way I want to sleep after having sex because even if I go down on her for 30 minutes + and she is squirming or screaming to the point she puts a pillow over her head... she never says she stops ""thinking about her day"" and as soon as it is over she doesn't feel what I have seen to be ""normal"" after an orgasm.  She never (or rarely) masturbates and she has never had an orgasm from masturbating. After dating for a little while she said she had not felt a desire for sex in months and she and her previous boyfriend rarely had sex.  **What ends up happening when it comes to sex is that one of us ends up feeling guilty.**  I'm not trying to be mean, but it is like she does not understand sexual advances or moods at all. She laughs whenever things start feeling sexy, which generally starts to turn me off. She almost never dresses sexy and then gets mad at me when I bring up how I would like her to wear lingerie or at least put something into looking nice for sex. Honestly, I admit I am probably being a little picky, but she leaves for work all dolled up, or she goes out with friends dressed to the nines but as soon as she comes home she ""feels uncomfortable"" so she takes it all off, washes off her makeup, puts her hair up, and then lounges around the house.  Is it wrong for me to expect my girlfriend to want to look nice for me? I shave, brush my teeth, do my hair (as she requests), and have generally changed my entire wardrobe since meeting her... all because I just figure that's what a boyfriend does. But if I make any comments about her appearance she gets defensive. Then she gets upset and says that everyone at work compliments her appearance but then she gets home and I don't! Well, she goes into ""I don't give a shit about my appearance mode"" when she gets home!  When I feel desperate for sex (after a week or two which sometimes happens due to period or whatnot) and just want to get off she feels ""used"".  **I don't know how to communicate ""hey, I feel sexually miserable right now but I don't want you to feel used"". Maybe my attitude toward sex is wrong?**  We get in arguments all the time, and generally they end up with me realizing I'm just super horny and sexually frustrated. Then I get off, I feel fine, and then all is good for me. But then she either feels horrible that I had to get off by myself or she feels used because we had sex and she wasn't quite in the mood. Then the argument starts up again because she can't understand how I could have sex after fighting with her and then feel fine.  Am I chauvinistic? Is my sex drive just too high?  **She says I make her feel guilty and so she gives in to having sex with me. And then she makes me feel awful for ""using her"".**  I feel terrible.  We are on the brink of breaking up but I am at a complete loss as to what to think about this. My hunch is that we are just not sexually compatible but she thinks that is ""not a big deal"" because ""if we care about eachother"" that ""should not matter.""  Has anyone been in a similar spot? Any tips on how to work through this?  **I'm completely torn. I feel guilty for wanting sex more than her. I feel guilty for asking for it.**  **TL; DR: Either she feels used or I feel denied and not wanted.**",relationshipadvice

3qomzh,3qomzh,MatrixCakes,"John owns the property and rents it to Ted. Ted has always paid his utility bills on time, and maintained a decent relationship with all of the utility companies that serve him. The property is rural, and an investment property. It's value is in it's privacy, fertility, closeness to town, and it's spring, which feeds four ponds and a seasonal creek vital to the area. This spring provides irrigation to several other agricultural properties. John has the water rights to this spring, and chooses to let it be natural and unaltered, and share the water with the other homeowners and farmers in the neighborhood. The spring has always been a home for multiple wildlife, possibly including some endangered wildlife.  Two days ago, the local power company claimed ""Easement rights"" on the property and clear cut a 300 ft x 30 ft area of spring water wetland through the property around power lines (owned by John). This will detrimentally affect the quality of water through the creek, and has drastically diminished the value of the property, both in timber and desirability. There is no longer untouched wetland. There is no longer ultimate privacy. They took all the timber they cut, which was possibly worth thousands. Tens of thousands.  They left no notice. When John called to ask why they clear cut his property, the power company admitted that they left no notice, and had no record of any permission being given. They claimed that it was legal as they had ""easement rights"" even though the lines were paid for by John, and I think ultimately John's property.  We would like to sue the power company for destroying our property and the seasonal wetland.   They also admitted that before they were caught cutting down all the trees, they were planning on applying herbicide to the area, potentially destroying farms nearby. The area they cut is a spring and would carry those herbicides via the creek it feeds to the surrounding agricultural area.  Do we have any legal grounds to sue?  If we can sue, what kind of non-profits would take our case? If there are no non-profits, what kind of lawyer should we hire? Collectively, we have the means, but not the way. We absolutely want to hold the power company responsible for the damage they caused to both the seasonal wetland and our property. I feel that many other rural homeowners could be saved by improved legislation regarding property intrusion by companies.  We are in rural Oregon, US.  Thank you for your input. I have no idea where to start. P.S. If the power company had given notice, John would have paid for the power company to move their power lines 20 ft, so it was over the driveway and not the spring. Or he could have run on generator power, or put up solar panels, or a wind turbine, or even a seasonal water turbine. There were plenty of other options other than clear cutting the property. P.S.S. The property is only a few miles away from a wildlife sanctuary, and they can provide previous research on the wetlands and it's inhabitants in question.

qi91i,qi91i,,"So when I met my current girlfriend last year around summer time, I had no clue who she was (she is a freshman this year, I am a junior. Say what you want, I'm 16 and she's 15).   Now, fast forward to this school year, when were fuck buddies and I was walking past her locker before lunch. I was talking to her, when all of the sudden one of her acquaintances walked up, and my jaw dropped. She was gorgeous, and I was definitely into her. So I asked my now girlfriend who she was, and she told me she was only talking to her because of mutual friends they share, seeing as this girl had done something to her (What  was done, I still have no clue). Anyways, I started talking to this new girl and we really kinda hit it off, she was supposed to come over and everything.

This makes it very difficult for me to cultivate new relationships, especially with people who aren't used to how I see and interact with the world  At any rate I ran into a girl I used to know that I had always thought was really cool. I ran into her on Saturday and she put her number in my phone and said to get ahold of her. Anyways I called her on the following tuesday and it rang to voice mail so I texted the following:  me: Hey [girls name] this is [my name] just wondering what you're up to, call me back :)  her: Hey lets hang out one of these days soon :)  me: Definitely whats a good day for you?  Her: thursday? :)  me: Sounds good I'll call you on thursday :)  She didn't reply to my last text and at that time I felt like I had made a mistake but I couldn't figure it out, I suspect I should have texted  her to make a more concrete plan but I didn't see a reason as she had implied she kept a very free schedule when we ran into eachother on saturday and I also have a very free schedule (my job is very flexible). So in my mind a call would probably suffice. Anyways there was no communication until I called her thursday, again it rang to voicemail so I texted the following:  Me: Hey I've gotten everything done that I had to today! when are you free?  Anyways she never replied. Leaving me feeling very hurt and confused which I must confess is a very foreign set of feelings for me.

1vcfgp,1vcfgp,,"Hey, I'm m18, and recently started dating a girl of the same age. Our honeymoon phase was wonderful: I've never met anyone who has more in common with me and it was passionate and relaxing and just felt right. Even when that phase ended, things seemed to adjust just fine. We'd had a few fights, but following one last week she says she worries we're becoming an abusive relationship. Laying out everything that's happened, I've seen her point. She finishes by saying that she needs to take a break, and with anyone else she'd leave them on the spot but she cares about me too much to not give me a second chance.  So. Here I am, working on going into some counseling, talking to my friends, people who know me, etc about my personality and what can be done to improve it. My worry is that she's just trying to let me go lightly; since our ""break"" started we haven't seen each other at all and in the few texts we've exchanged she speaks to me as if we're already just friends. When we're getting along this girl makes me happy in a way nobody else can. What do I need to do so I don't ruin my chances now and we can get back together in the future?",relationshipadvice

3c14v5,3c14v5,UnknownXV,"Hi,   I recently found a subreddit for lending to people in need of quick money /r/borrow and I'm very interested in helping with some loans if I can in the future, but after reading their lender FAQ and visiting the wiki page on usury, it appears that Canada limits annual interest rates on a loan to a mere 60%.  Given the high risk nature of these loan requests, I'm not sure I'd be willing to lend at such a small interest rate (again relative to the risk). For example, a $300 loan for a month couldn't pay me more than $15 at 60% annual interest. That doesn't seem worth the risk at all. Even worse, living in Quebec it seems to be limited to 30% annually. Which means $7.50 for a month loan of $300. Even if I was a billionaire that wouldn't be a good bet.   Are there any Canadians here who understand this law more, is there an exception for online loans, micro loans, or short-term loans? Something that would allow me to legally loan people money? Maybe if it's online, loaning to someone who doesn't live in Canada, does that except me from this insane law?  Thanks!

Drinking a cup or two a day is normal and in most cases is not hazardous for your health, although from a very technical, formal standpoint, yes your body is building a tolerance to and dependence on caffeine. Certainly different amounts are appropriate for different people: a few glasses of wine a week is fine for most people, but not for recovering alcoholics; similarly, a cup or two of coffee a day is fine for most people but not for recovering caffeine junkies who were drinking so much that it gave them kidney stones.   So this is tricky. On the one hand, your girlfriend's reaction to your coffee drinking is coming from a place of concern, which is something you should appreciate. On the other hand, her concern should not stray into the realm of control or trying to change who you are.   So if her ""concern"" is making you uncomfortable, then you need to sit down with her and spell out how you feel about it.

dadey0n,5elmj5,Mirgo,"Thanks for your answers.  I'll definitely not threaten the other party with the police report then. I knew that threatening to report a crime to obtain a bribe was illegal, but I wasn't sure if that applied to cases like this, so thanks for clearing that up.  Frankly I'm beginning to feel at a loss at this point. The debtor continues to lie under oath and play the system in order to avoid paying his debt to me. It is less than a $3,000 debt, and he has retained a lawyer specifically for this case and even attempted to dissolve his company over this matter. At some point, I feel that some force needs to be applied to mend this situation. Assuming the police actually take up this matter, he can work in prison to pay me off, and it's better to consider filing than doing nothing and getting nothing in return.  Concerning the punitive damages, I was only going to ask for twice the amount of the judgement(assuming there were no statutory limits). I have evidence from the debtor's examination that he testified that his business had no assets, yet I was able to recover money from it, and he claimed at the debtor's examination that he does his banking at the bank I had levied, yet I was only able to recover a small amount. I would say that both instances could be argued to be perjury. I also have a recorded call from their lawyer where he said, ""they don't want to pay anywhere near the $3,000"", when attempting to settle the judgement previously. Finally, I can personally testify to many times my boss has said ""you won't get any money"", though I realize that's only my word.

g8eqh,g8eqh,Sirwootalot,"This is gonna be long, so a bit of pre-relationship background first: I am an almost-21 year old responsibly hedonistic seasoned veteran of hook-ups, one-night-stands, and casual flings who, in junior high and high school, was in 12 different relationships; only two of which lasted longer than three weeks for varying reasons. Some might have called call me a man-whore; I preferred ""ethically non-monogamous"". Favorite things to do include going to goth clubs/shows, parties, trying new restaurants, and infusing my own alcohol.  She is almost 19 and the textbook definition of innocent and virginal: zero experience whatsoever with love, much less sex. She goes out of her way to be un-feminine and not be noticed despite a wonderwoman figure; baggy clothes, no makeup or jewelry or piercings. Would occasionally think ""a boyfriend might be nice"" or ""I wonder why I'm the only one of my friends who doesn't obsess over guys"", then resume putting her nose to the grindstone at work and school. Favorite things include volunteering at vet clinics and animal shelters, rollerblading, LARPing, and spending time with her family.  We'd known each other on and off for about four years. Our relationship starting was a classic example of friends &gt; close friends &gt; love, to the point that it completely snuck up on me. We'd been hanging out roughly once every two weeks for a few months when, in a completely unexpected show of balls of steel, she let me know that she'd had a huge crush on me for years. I told her (honestly) that, while my first thought was ""there's no way it'll work, i'm too filthy"", let's keep hanging out as friends and see what happens. Within a month she'd had her first kiss and on her birthday the next month we became official. The thing that lead to the realization that I actually, genuinely was in love with her (a very rare occurrence for me) was that, about a week after her confession, I had sex with another girl i'd been seeing on and off and the entire time all I could think about was how much i'd rather be with her (current GF) and how horrible I felt for being with someone else. Most of all, I realized that while I was having fun with my lifestyle, it felt empty and that I needed genuine romantic love to be truly happy with someone. There was a point where I told her about polyamory and asked her what she would think of an open relationship, as I was having difficulty going cold-turkey on how I used to live; after two days of seeing how hurt and confused she was by the mere suggestion, I dropped the idea.  The relationship itself between then and now has consisted of the two of us slowly meeting in the middle - her becoming comfortable with gradually more and more things in the bedroom / going out more socially as I adjusted to the strange, foreign territory of enjoying being committed and monogamous. The first month left me feeling profoundly depressed; I was convinced I had made a huge mistake, in no way would be able to make it work, and would inevitably break my good friend's heart. We found our groove though, and continued to ride it without much consequence until nearly two months ago.  She got to the point of telling me she was ready to lose her virginity, which again blew me out of the water - she's still never had an orgasm, as she without fail gets anxious and asks me to stop when it got too intense. That night was easily our high point; I was convinced that all of our problems were solved (her fearing physical intimacy, me having a nearly subhuman sex drive) and that everything would be peachy from that point on.  Instead, it was a slow decline. Rather than continue to gradually move forward, we hit a roadblock - she simply does not enjoy sex at all any more, or other sexual activities. She seldom did; the way she explains it, her mind functions on such a purely logical cause-and-effect level that she has absolutely no clue how to simply let go or how to be overcome with passion, and I'd say it's a dead-accurate assessment. The closest she ever got to ""finishing"" was what i'd estimate to be 90%, but now, it never even gets to 5% before she wants to stop. Apparently, the overriding state of mind is ""why am I doing this"" as opposed to ""oh hey, this is pretty fun"". I've spent countless hours explaining things to her from the start; at times, I feel more like a hands-on relationship 101 teacher than a boyfriend.   I'm completely honest, and rarely sugarcoat; I  recently told her that i'm starting to fall out of love with her because my patience is just spread far too thin, and the stress is profoundly affecting the rest of my life - I spend my time worrying about ""us"" when I haven't been properly employed for just over a year and am only making rent each month because I scrape money together by being a weekly maid for each of my parents/grandparents, and my apartment is usually a godawful mess because i'm never home long enough to do much other than fall asleep, wake up, and leave again usually to visit her. I simply cannot continue to function on such a low level of passion and intimacy, and not just in the bedroom either; I was hit with the crushing realization that only once in our nine months have I seen her truly excited for something, and it had absolutely nothing to do with our relationship (recounting a difficult battle at one of her LARPing sessions, which i've since attended with her and enjoyed). Worse, it never even *occurs* to her to do things like buy/make a random gift, surprise me with dinner, or any other conceivable non-verbal gesture of love. I'm not her lover, i'm her human-shaped talking security blanket, and I can't stand it anymore. I gave her an ultimatum of a month to turn around, and already her first suggestions have been ways to back out of being passionate or intimate (IE try an open relationship for my sake even though she wouldn't dream of also taking advantage of it) as she seemingly has near-zero confidence in her own ability to enjoy herself. I have tried nearly every thing imaginable to try and light her fire - buy her a still-unopened vibrator, watch romantic movies together, try new hobbies to do together like dance studios or roller rinks - and fail every time because I hit a massive wall of pure logic in her mind that prevents her from taking anything simply and for its own sake. We both know there's almost nothing I can do by myself to save this anymore, and the thought is painful. All I can do is sit here and hope desperately that she flips a switch somewhere before I completely lose all desire to be with her. I've never loved someone so ridiculously much, but even as I type this I feel it fading and fear that what i'm losing now may never come back.  TL;DR opposites attracted and came close to compromise only to now be going slowly backwards again, despite being madly in love. I need to know what you would do in this situation, as i'm completely out of ideas. Should add that I have no interest in pursuing an open relationship unless it's what she truly wants, not I.",relationshipadvice

You can ask someone's opinion on almost anything and keep the conversation rolling easily by asking more questions.   Also, practice with the girls that you aren't interested in. Don't ask them out or lead them on, but just talk and ask questions. Your comfort level will rise. Also, nothing will make a girl more interested in you than other girls interested in you.   Sadly, the best way to get more comfortable around girls is to get your heart broken a time or two. You'd be amazed how easy it is to get shot down and not give a fuck.",relationshipadvice

He admitted fault immediately, and I got the contact info of a witness who was willing to corroborate the events.  I decided it wasn't serious enough to call the police - didn't seem necessary (maybe a mistake?). My car has decent damage, but still drive-able and I was close to home. His car was worse off and required a tow which he was working on when I left.  We exchanged driver's license and insurance paperwork. I took photos of his ID and paperwork, along with photos of the vehicle damage.   Was a little shaken up, and ready to get out of there after collecting what I deemed necessary.  After getting home I realized his DL is not valid - it's an Identification Card. A quick google search shows he was booked for a DWI about two years ago...  But the insurance policy paperwork looks legit. Still within the active term, coverage for the same car I hit, even got a payment receipt showing he made a premium payment three days ago.

History is that we have been friends. We would hang in a group of kids, since we live in a small town. When we first got close, he and all our friends would hang out at eachother's homes together, all lay on beds. Such and such. The whole group was 5 of us, three guys, two girls.  Nothing really changed except a few more additions of two more guys and Michael's brother have been added to our group. Ive always thought Michael would make a great husband becase of the way his home life has been. He's been working since he was 14 to help his family out.   Anyways.. The friday night school let out for christmas break, me and Michael made out on our friends bed after a night of cuddling.  The next night we made out again, at a party, in front of other people. He even kissed me on the forehead. In my mind, that's a sure sign of liking some one.  Few nights later, we have sex at his house a couple times.  We brought in the new year together, had celebratory sex too.  Then I started drunk texting him. He never answers. He says he just wants to be friends. I found out he's been ""talking"" to his boss's daughter. I'm crushed and angry. I really started to fall for him. He apologizes and says he didn't mean to make me feel used after I confront him.   This past saturday night, we had sex, and he mention twice, in a very stern voice, that we weren't going to tell anyone, not even our best friends.

p9lx2,p9lx2,,"I've been in a relationship for four years now with a woman that I am completely in love with. We get along in every possible way and knew each other for over a year before we started dating. We're both in our mid-twenties. We currently live together and openly discuss our commitment to one another. She tells me I'm a good mate and is grateful for the things I do and I do the same to her. In every way but one, our relationship feels very healthy.    When we started dating, we had sex regularly and often. Every other day, if not every. Good sex too (as far as I understand).    For the past year or so, she seems generally uninterested in sex. I think that what started it was her birth control. She gained weight and was unhappy with her figure. She had difficulty acheiving orgasm. The combination of these things definitely hurt our sex life. Eventually, she stopped using that birth control and everything reverted to normal (and along with her hard work, her weight did too). The sex didn't. On average, we have sex once a month.  I've been in relationships in the past where this same thing occurred. One girl eventually stopped having sex with me for months and months. The relationship was doomed to fail, but I was in love and I put up with it until the unavoidable breakup. Another girl stopped being interested in sex and started being more interested in drugs. In the end, I broke it off with her for other reasons, but that was definitely a deciding factor. I don't think I'm without baggage, but I'm unable to clearly see anything that I'm doing wrong.   With my sex drive being unfulfilled, I'm spending more time fulfilling it on my own than I ever have as  a teenager. I don't really enjoy it either, it's like I have to do it so I won't go crazy. I would never turn down sex for masturbation ever, but I'm growing increasingly needy for... something.  We've discussed the lack of sex and things rarely change. We agree to work on it. The discussion kind of dilutes the sexiness of sex. No one wants to feel like they owe/are owed sex.  For a while, I tried to initiate sex more often than she and I was almost always told in one way or another that she was too tired. I've since stopped. The rejection started to hurt too much.  Our personalities are both strong, but we often compromise or sacrifice for the sake of the other. When I've tried to act more dominant and decisive in our relationship, she mistakes that for anger.   I'm feeling emasculated. I'm there for every aspect of our relationship, but when sex gets taken out of it, I just feel like a stuffed animal. Snuggling seems to be our only physical outlet and I'm starting to resent it. Is she just bored with me? Is this just ""how it goes?"" Worse yet, do women in general get bored with me?   I truly don't know if it's me or her. I'd imagine that it's both of us in some way. I've never felt more distant from the girl that I love more than anything. I'm at a complete loss.",relationshipadvice

lysqr,lysqr,,"So, we are in a long distance relationship for the last 1.5 of 3 years. It's not a total LDR as we are together 3 months, then away for 3 months. I think we were a very loving couple and it was a steady relationship apart from some small ldr troubles.  A couple of months ago, while I was away from her, I came to know that she met this foreign diplomat at a party who gave her his number. Didn't think much about it, but few days later she told me she accidentally met him somewhere and asked my permission to date him for a short while to kill loneliness (she said it would be nothing more than kissing). I was shocked to the core and categorically said NO. She agreed, but then I suspected that she already went out on a date with him. I found out that they were exchanging pictures and emails and called her up about her ""accidental meetup"" story. I wanted to break up with her then, but she convinced me that it was just a small silly thing that she did. She said they did exchange emails, but still insisted that she met him accidentally. I thought she had learnt her lesson as she said she would never talk to him again.  I came back few days ago to her and we were together and having a perfect date. Things were going great and after spending the night together, I checked her phone the next morning and saw that she was messaging that guy all the time during our date, while sitting besides me. They were sending kisses over messages. My gf asked him if he was horny. The guy was asking her if she was up for having sex with him, or just kissing and touching. He invited her to his apartment. My gf didn't reply to these messages and was probably trying to divert the topic to other things, but she didn't stop talking to him after such messages.  I realized that my gf's fantasies of dating someone else and kissing/getting felt up by someone are not really fantasies, but she is actually planning on these lines. I confronted her, and she first got angry on me checking her phone, then broke down. She said they exchanged emails first, and then actually went out on a date. The ""accidental meetup"" story was indeed a fabrication. Then they stopped talking after our fight, but then restarted just couple of days ago. She said she just wasn't thinking anything and went with the flow. I am fairly sure that now she is telling me the truth and they didn't do anything physical -- they just had the date and the messaging, but she was planning to go ahead with kissing etc.  I am a wreck now and don't know what to do. On one side, I really really love her, she is the love of my life for me. I know that she loves me a lot too. She wasn't planning to leave me. On the other side, I feel really devastated that she lied to me all along when I was pleading her to tell me the truth. And then, she was talking such things to another guy while sitting besides me. She has broken down too, and pleading continuously to forgive her. She accepts her mistake and is trying to assure me that this wouldn't ever happen again and she would love me forever.  Reddit, help me figure out what to do. I am so devastated, I can't think of anything clearly.

The landlord declined via E-mail. I have that saved. * Take pictures / record video of condition at move out. I have direct pictures of the window sills, light fixtures, and refrigerator. I also have approximately 11 minutes of move out videos. I included a newspaper in these and uploaded them to my Google Drive, so the dates on the videos can't be contested.

So I've been dating this girl for about 9 1/2 months now, and it's been long distance the whole time, and recently it's kind been winding down a little. Well, not really winding down, we're quite serious and involved, but things that have been happening have caused us to fight quite a lot, and I started feeling less strongly. After something that happened a couple weeks back, I had planned to break up about a week ago, but we talked and really, I just didn't have the heart to do it. I knew we were going to break up relatively soon anyway, I guess I was just procrastinating sort of (which I know is a terrible thing to do in this situation).  Fast forward to Friday night... I got extremely drunk, had a little E, and hooked up with a random. I don't know what came over me. Initially I just thought ""OK, that's it, I'll have to break it off right away and that's that."" I haven't broken it off yet, we were/are going to have that talk tonight.   However, now I'm feeling very conflicted over the whole thing. I'm thinking about telling her the truth about it, and having it end there, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. I was going to break it off anyway, and I know that telling her will really hurt her, but she doesn't want to break up (because she doesn't know), and I don't want to break up with her having her still wanting to be with me, when if she knew everything she absolutely wouldn't.  So my question is this: Do I tell her, have her hate me and break up with me, and have her be hurt by both the breakup and the cheating, or do I just break up with her, telling her it is because of the other reasons we were going to break up, and leave it at that? To anyone who has experienced this from either end, what happened, and which way would you prefer it?  I guess you should know that I love this girl dearly, and we were only going to break up because of the distance, plus we're not completely compatible for being together forever or anything like that, so it just seemed like the issues we've been having aren't really worth it to keep dealing with if we're not going to be together forever anyway.

The need to avoid can be so great that they will compromise relationships, school, jobs, etc. rather than risk being exposed to the feared object.  For example: someone with a dog phobia works on the top floor of a tall building, and sees a dog emerging from the elevator one day.  That person refuses to take the elevators again, and walks up the stairs every day.  *They do not intentionally seek out the thing that they fear.* If they really can't avoid the feared object, they experience intense distress until they're able to escape the situation.  http://behavenet.com/node/21596   If your friend is claiming to have a dog phobia, he can go fuck himself.

c1r6l1t,gx4ls,GrandadsLadyFriend,"Hey. Girl here. First, it sounds like you've been through a tough time and have a lot of feelings about that.  I can't help much with that, but here's just an opinion from a third party.  As hard as it will be, I urge you to move on from this girl.  You justify wanting to maintain a ""friendship"" with her because you would miss her company otherwise.  But all this will do is hold you back in life because you'll always have this sliver of false hope anchoring you to this stagnant chapter of your life.  Not to mention, you'll only be used by her for company and sex on her terms, whenever she feels you're worth her time.  She cannot be a true ""friend"" to you.  Be cordial, sure, but limit your time with her and set some real boundaries.  I understand that getting back into dating may be hard.  But, kinda like you're not supposed to expect losing your virginity to be glorious, you can't expect your first attempt at dating again to be successful or an accurate measure of your real, eventual dating potential.  In fact, I'd suggest just being single for a while and working on building your own identity separate from the girl you've been committed to for so long.  Build your friendships.  Hobbies.  Job.  Then once you feel a little more balanced, maybe hit on some girls at a friend's party or try online dating.  Start slow.  Which reminds me- the note you wrote to the girl is sweet, and she probably appreciated it and you needed to get your feelings out somehow and just connect to a person.  However, once you seriously want to get back into dating, this is not the best way to pick up a girl.  Girls like confidence and security.  Bartender will read your note, say, ""Awww, he's so sweet.  Poor thing,"" and not feel an ounce of attraction to you.  But it sounds like she's off limits anyway, so maybe she's more of an emotional support, and new girls will be dating material once you get your game back.  Lastly, I know heartbreak is tough.  I'm sorry.  It will hurt, and I can't say how long.  But just don't lose hope that there's happiness out there for you, because there is.  Just be reasonable about your dating expectations at this moment where you're a little weak from emotional distress, and remember that many many people have experienced similar heartbreak and were still able to find new love.  Best of luck.",relationshipadvice

djcg0xe,6j74v4,Embargo4life,"This area of law is in flux right now in Canada.  The old law was that prostitution was legal, but ""communicating for the purpose"" of prostitution, in public, was illegal.  This prohibited standing on the corner offering sex, for example.  However in 2014 the Supreme Court struck down these laws in a case called Bedford.  For a brief time there were no laws about prostitution.  Then the conservative government under Harper enacted new laws, which basically say that you can't buy sex but you can sell it.  Advocacy groups immediately criticized these new laws and many believe they will be struck down as well.  But it will take a few years for this to work its way through the courts.  Meanwhile, Harper lost the election to the liberals under Trudeau.  Now the liberals have made noises about maybe amending the laws passed by the conservatives.  Police and prosecutors have largely reacted to this situation with a collective ""WTF?!?""  As far as I know very few resources are being dedicated to investigating prostitution, other than gangs that traffic in child prostitutes and such.  Nobody knows what the law will look like in a year or two.  And frankly, most Canadians don't care that much.  As for why people are advertising escort services on the internet, the answer is mainly that they've been doing it for years and police mostly don't bother them.  Even if they get charged they would never get any jail.  Prostitution laws have always been weird in Canada but now they're in a weirder place than ever.

Preview tl;dr - The fact she has a 7 year old girl is the major factor in me not wanting to continue the relationship.   To note, I'm 28 and a year older than her and I'm not 100% sure I want to end the relationship.  I've been with a her for over a year, met her on a dating site. I was avoiding anyone that listed they had a child, and when I messaged the her she didn't have that part filled out, but she let me know in her very first message that she had a 6 year old girl. I met with her anyway, thinking why not. In the year since then I discovered I would be leaving the Navy, got accepted into college (more on that later...) and bought a house, and have gone through many medications for my BPD.  At first it was no problem at all, she lived with her dad so we had a babysitter three nights a week. However her dad had to move away last October because he lost his job. We've already almost broken up twice(for the same reason), so she already knows the situation is hard for me.   Anyway, since then she and the kid have been staying at my house from Friday evening to Sunday morning, and I go to her place twice a week. My house is over 2000 sq ft, but the kid is always in our hair, despite giving books, toys and video games to entertain her.   I believe this would be a good time to mention I'm bipolar (if you didn't already get the hint about my BPD). I'm more depressive than manic, but I'd say it's at least 80% controlled thanks to my friend Lamictal. Still it doesn't help. My problems with the relationship before could be attributed to having a bad week. But now I think I seriously just don't want this relationship anymore. Being in college now pushed that point greatly.  There are just too many girls here. It's been a month and I've soft approached three girls, rejected one, but I'm planning to ask one to lunch tomorrow and see how things go from there.   On the plus side the gf is wonderful and we get along great. She is the first perfectly non-crazy girl I've fallen in love with. I'm just not into the relationship now, and also I'm getting the feeling I don't want to go through Valentine's day not being into it.

The reality of the situation has finally caught up to me and I'm P-I-S-S-E-D. I want to hand this sleazy asshole a plate of cold hard reality and walk away and never look back. I deserve a hell of a lot better than this shitshow of a situation.  Of course he tried to defend himself by saying they only got married for financial perks while he was in the army, she's cheated on him, and they have a lot of problems in their relationship, blah blah fucking blah. He keeps repeating this over and over again but it justifies nothing for me – is it fair to tell him that’s between him and his wife and those problems are not mine?   We were on the phone and I realized I was word vomiting and blabbering, so I told him I needed to hang up and resume the conversation later when I’ve collected my thoughts and know exactly what I want to say. He’s been texting me nonstop with all this bullshit about how he loves me, he’d do anything to keep me, he’s never felt this way about anyone before, what we have is rare and special, he doesn't want to lose me as a friend, etc etc etc. Basically all the bullshit you feed to someone you know you've wronged but still want to keep around. I am immune to it and every line he feeds me pushes me away even more.  This guy is a shitshow of personal problems that I do not want to get involved in – it’s whatever the female equivalent of the saying ‘don’t stick your dick in crazy’ would be. I want to cut all ties with him and never see him or talk to him again, or at least for a very long time, but I have no idea where to start.

Basically, I think my girlfriend is lying to me.  We have a strong relationship currently and we're very open with each other. We once talked about exes, (I don't have any or had any connection with another). She told me had two.  One in middle school for two weeks. She said it was nothing and short lived.   The second one was Long term(3 years) and a abusive one. She got herself out of it during our first few days of talking.  She then fell for me and now we strongly feel we're meant for each other. But now I've reason to believe there was a third ex she didn't tell me about.  And it doesn't seem he was a bad person or anything. I ended up finding pictures of them together and she looked happy. Actually happy.  She told me that she's felt alone and only was in the abusive relationship because she was afraid of being alone. So it was a complete shocker to me finding this out. I should include that she told me that she has never done any Sexual stuff. Not even kissed, like me.  But now I've reason to she's lying about that and maybe even more.   Why would she lie to me? I don't know what to do I feel devastated. I'd talk this out with her right now but she just got her period and is in a lot of pain and just not emotionally stable. So i don't want to bring this up and have an argument or something unfold.  But I'm tired of holding it in and feeling like shit about this.

d7q9wjy,535s8o,Floomby,"If the account is joint, any of the people named on the account can legally remove 100% of it. Overcontrolling parents often do this if they suspect that their children are about to bolt. It doesn't matter if you earned all the money or not; they can drain it completely at any moment.   If the car is under their name and yours is not on the title at all, then legally it 100% theirs. Thus it is a ""gift"" only in the sense that they allow you to drive it. (IANAL, just a grownup.) You could always ask them to put it in your name, seeing as it's supposed to be a gift. If they say no, don't push it. You don't want them to get alarmed enough to take the money out.   I would say that if you really feel that their primary motivation is control, no matter what, and if you feel that your home life is unbearable, Step 1 would be to go to various excellent sites that deal with what is domestic abuse and how to escape it. [Love is Respect](http://loveisrespect.org) and [The National Domestic Violence Hotline](http://thehotline.org). Even though this is not a romantic relationship, you are an adult, and nobody should be trying to control your life and keep you dependent and trapped.   Step 2 would be to make a plan for leaving. You can use these sites, and you could call a therapist who specializes in recovering with abuse, or a women's shelter. If your savings can cover it, find a shared living arrangement. At your age, you may be eligible to get student loans to cover housing.   You want to get that money out as the last step, because once it's out, your parents will know the jig's up. Leave the car at theirs, Uber to your new place, and get a new phone if the current one is on their account.   Your clothes could probably be considered yours. Anything else, such as the furniture, they could probably claim to be theirs.   Put your money in a new account at a different bank, and off you go.",legaladvice

ccza7or,1p56ss,Cardboardlion,"No swapping and don't just come up to her and ask right away. Start a conversation, wait till it's wrapping up and then you two options depending how forward you want to be, you can say something along the lines of:  1) Hey, so I was thinking, would you want to go out sometime? (In case you're not experienced in asking women out, you normally don't go with something so general but at this point you're just setting up the expectation for asking her number so it's fine). If she says yes and/or is generally receptive you can follow it up with ""awesome, what's your number?""  2) ""Oh, by the way, I wanted to call you the other day but then I realized I actually never got your number."" This is a 'safer' approach. It's less intimidating and you don't have to ask her out right then and there. Honestly, different women prefer different approaches and it's a matter of gauging how open she is or how interested in you she is to know which to use.  Also, using this line might run the risk of her asking why you wanted to call her, either have something good to say or be prepared to tell you wanted to ask her out and since you're already telling her that, and she have her number already, just ask, she'll probably say yes. (As an example of what you can say you originally wanted to call them for outside of asking them out, the last time I used this it was on a friends roommate and I just told her I was looking for advice on picking out a birthday gift for our friend).   One last note, if you get her number without asking her out then, don't wait more than 2 days too. I usually call by the next night (though a majority of the time I just do option 1 as it's more straightforward and falls into my personal dating philosophy).

Anyways, I have a hard time composing myself when I talk to her about our issues so I wrote it in a letter and I don't know if I should actually give it to her or look it over and memorize it like a fucking homework assignment. It's just been very stressful on me and I want to hear some advice. Here's the letter....  First off, I want to tell you that I only wrote this to help us both out. I feel like there is an unspoken thing between us right now and we’re both too shy or scared to talk about it unless we’re drunk and when that happens nothing gets answered anyways. I need to get some things off my chest.  I think we really do love each other but over time we have drifted away from that. We're still very comfortable around each other and are able to talk but I feel that the spark we once had between each other has gone out. We love each other but I feel like we're no longer in love with each other. I understand that the fact that my job probably had an impact on our relationship and we were more or less living like a long distance relationship couple. I just don't know what we're supposed to do now. We're getting a new place together and it's another 12 months of commitment to each other. I want to know what you want to do. I want to know if you want to try and make things work. I know it's been a while but I have to bring it up, when you had a boy here and you were sleeping next to him. Has anything like that happened since? I went through your facebook and saw that you have customized your profile to only show a select few of our friends to see that we're in a relationship. I just want to know what you think about all this because if you are unhappy with me than I feel like I have the right to know. We aren't intimate anymore which usually is a sign of infidelity but I'm not going to accuse you of anything. I feel like you're usually pretty honesty with me and I try to be with you. I love you but right now I feel like we're friends living together and trying to help each other out. We try to eat healthy, exercise and further our careers together. There's just certain parts of our relationship that are missing and I want to know if that's something that can be repaired and even if it can, is that something that you want to do. I wrote this because it gives me time to gather my thoughts and put them down instead of tearing up when I talk to you while we're both intoxicated.

I met this girl (25) on a dating site about 8 months ago. I initially hit it off with her pretty well, even though we are glaring opposites.  I rather quickly realized that there was no 'rush' of falling in love. But I shook it off me as a side effect of my breakdown a few years back.   -----  Quick background story time!  In early 2011 I had a mental and physical breakdown. This came after my family tried to hustle me out of my home, insane stress at work and a girlfriend suddenly leaving me for someone else after living with her for more than 6 years. This is not the first girl I've been with since then, but they sure made me know what a wreck' and pretty quickly and sent me along.  -----  I thought the feeling would come stronger the more I learned about this girl. That I was just a bit hurt inside and being close to her would make it come along.  Everything has been really nice for me. She made me do a comeback in the kitchen. She accepted my quirks and was really understanding. I had time to grow inside myself, without any relationship pressure.  Neither of us have introduced the other to family or friends. So I kinda just went along with it. Having female company was really nice. Not even for the sex, which is rare, completely because of me. I always just felt better having a partner. I just need to cuddle. Manly... Yes...  This fall, she really started to take up a lot of my time, and I started feeling a bit uncomfortable with it.  When December came I felt fed up. I didn't feeling like seeing her more than once a week. Max. And then it hit me. It's not the woman I have a future with.  At that time she was really over encumbered by exams, and I did not want to break the news to her then, and inflict her the pain I felt by getting dumped in a stressful period of my life. Then came Christmas, and what asshole dumps a girl at Christmas? ...and suddenly it's mid-January. Her birthday is next week, and she just called and invited me to a big family birthday, as her father apparently shares the date and turn 50. I got the usual ""It's ok to say no."" I told her I had to think about it. A few hours have passed and I feel like an enormous ass to have 'played' her like this, but honestly, I though we had a mutual, but silent, agreement. I have just went along with time. Working on myself. ...and she has really helped me on my way. But she is not the one, and I need to think about both her future and my own.

1711p9,1711p9,,"After about a month of fighting and constant ups &amp; downs, I suggested to my bf of about a year that we spend some time apart. He is a bit older than me and we are very different people. I am in grad school and he works at a bar, having never finished college. Our differences in age/education/career paths have never bothered, but family and friends have always been very skeptical about our relationship. Almost everyone says we are too different and that it won't last.   The problems... He's recently quit smoking and uses that as an excuse for losing his temper with me. School keeps me incredibly busy, and I admit, sometimes I don't have the patience to be the most supportive girlfriend on the quitting smoking issue. He's also having some vague financial problems that he won't discuss with me. Often when I try to talk to him about our issues, he gets frustrated and asks ""Are you trying to start a fight?"" which makes me feel like I can't communicate with him.   We both have short tempers and the fights usually start with me confronting him about something, he responds angrily: ""I just can't do anything right"" or ""You seem to only find faults with me"", and end with me not willing to talk anymore because I don't know how to without him making hurtful accusations at me.   We still love each other, and I'm really hoping the time apart will bring some clarity into the relationship. We agreed not to date anyone else during the break and to keep contact with each other to a bare minimum. But someone recently told me ""breaks"" are just ""break-up tryouts"", and that usually it means the end is near. Is this true? Can I do anything during this time to mend the relationship?",relationshipadvice

hd1ew,hd1ew,,"Hi.  So this guy I know has been asking me if I wanted to hang out with him. He's not a bad person, but he's known for being pretty gross. I find him immature, I don't have many similar interests to him. Further, no one I know likes him-- *no one*. It's pretty extreme, and I feel a little bit bad about it. All of my friends, and even people I don't know very well, whenever his name comes up, have some fairly terrible stories about him. I like to give him the benefit of the doubt, as I don't assume that people are the same forever, and I am generally friendly to him... or at least I try to be. If I were in his shoes I'd feel like shit because I'm sure don't people give him a chance, but hey-- college is next year, he can remake himself.  Anyway, I haven't seen him in like a year and he started FB messaging me a week ago, asking if I wanted to go out and get coffee, saying he'd had a crush on me for a long time. I was wishy washy-- I said ""I like getting coffee and I like low-key gatherings but I don't like what that implies."" At the time I said that, I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to go out and get coffee with him or not. We then chatted a bit more and he asked me some fairly tactless questions about whether I'd dated anyone, and I was eventually fairly firm that I wasn't interested in dating at this point in time.   Tonight, about a week later, he asked if I was available to hang out tonight-- it's like 9pm, so I said no, it was too late. He asked me if I was free tomorrow and I said ""I don't particularly want to spend time with you.""  I apologized about that and whatnot, but he was probably upset at that and logged off. Do you think I was being impolite, or is this just how this shit works? He has some serious guts for asking someone he has a crush on if they want to get coffee-- good onya, I don't yet have the guts to do that-- but I just don't want to get to know him or spend time with him. I don't think he likes me for legitimate reasons though. He doesn't really know me, and everyone says he's desperate, so I think he was assuming I am just because I haven't dated anyone.  **Also**, after I said I didn't want to spend time with him, I almost invited him to go on a walk with me tonight, actually, because I thought I might give it a chance to hang out and what the hell. I really like going on walks and it might be fun to go on a walk with someone I don't know well. But would that have been way worse? I really do not want to date him at all or be associated with him in a tangible way, and that would have probably led him on. He claimed he wants to be friends OR date, but I suspect that he's only interested in being ""friends"" so that we eventually date.",relationshipadvice

He can do whatever he wants around them, even sleep at their house if he wants (note: this never comes up because we're the world's clingiest couple and we haven't slept apart in almost 3 years).  He used to have this one female friend who hated me, treated me like shit if we were out in public together and badmouthed me behind my back. I was very uncomfortable when they hung out alone because I just kept expecting her to try to start shit.   He's also had a few friends who have had little girly crushes on him. They made me a bit uncomfortable too. I trust him implicitly, but it doesn't take much to cause drama, especially in a university environment. I just don't need to deal with that. Fortunately, he is of the same mind and most of the melodramatic friendships don't last long. I absolutely do not tell him he can't hang out with people, but he is aware when I am getting uncomfortable.  Anyway, that's how it works in my relationship. YMMV.",relationshipadvice

I just hope you understand why - your threshold for satisfaction is much lower than hers, and probably lower than the average. It doesn't take much, relatively speaking, for you to feel completely fulfilled and happy. Your needs were probably being met and even exceeded, while hers were not quite there yet.

The last few weeks it didn't feel right at all and I felt empty, and when I saw her, disinterested. She picked up after a while (I told her I didn't feel right) and forced me to choose whether I wanted to go on or not. She had told me she loved me, I had told her, though I never felt very convinced (though the word has no real meaning to me). So yesterday I told her I'd tell her today and I ran into a girl on the train who was in exactly the same position. We ended up sleeping together (though we had no sex) and I felt similar to when sleeping with my ex-gf. So in retrospect I figure that I just really like sleeping next to girls and that was all (although the first few months, it was more, but after a while we couldn't really just talk, it was mostly amazing sex - which was also over the last few weeks). I went to her place to break up, saw some pictures we took last weekend and had second thoughts, but still pulled it through.

d8hf8wi,566yxx,PedernalesFalls,"PT here. I use 97110 and 97530 all the time, but *never* during the same session. They overlap too much and insurance gets fussy about it, so we end up getting less because they reimburse less for each if you use them together (so you'd get more total from insurance if you billed 2 units of 97110 OR 2 units of 97530). It looks like he's trying to document the max number of codes for the least amount of time, but he's an idiot because he should know those codes can't go together. Here's what happened:   One unit is 8 minutes to 22 minutes, so to bill two units of the same code you must perform said code for 23-37 minutes. So you can get more charges for less time if you split them up. Two units of 97530=23 min, but one each of 97110 and 97530=16 min. Chiro sees that they have lots of overlap and believes he can justify 8 min worth of each. But insurance knows this game, so they squash him down. I don't know about chiro codes, but the other two are PT codes. So because they are PT codes that aren't compatible they get denied. I'd bet he's going to be an ass about it (but maybe that's because I'm a PT) and make you pay. Then he doesn't have to mess with insurance. If he were smarter or less greedy, I'd bet insurance would have covered 2 units of 97110 or 97530 and there would be no problem. But be wanted to save those sweet sweet 7 minutes and bill something stupid. If he was professional he would:  1. recode and resubmit. 2. Own up to his error and eat it. 3. Be on his game and notify patents of their deductible.  But he's a dumbass because those codes never work together. That is a rookie mistake and indicates to me that he's not billing properly for anyone.   That said, it might be hard to argue the billing in small claims because the differences are so subtle.

daq51l5,5g7908,giraffe_taxi,"Thank you for that cite. I'm not familiar with it, but i just read it, and reviewed the subsequent amendment to PC 187.  &gt;  The Davis ruling held that a fetus had to have progressed beyond the embryonic stage for its killing to be considered murder.  I don't believe that is a correct reading. This is from the majority ruling, in the same paragraph that you seem to refer to with the seven weeks thing, cites removed and highlights added:  &gt; Generally, however, a fetus is defined as ""the unborn offspring in the postembryonic period, after major structures have been outlined."" This period occurs in humans ""seven or eight weeks after fertilization"", and is a determination to be made by the trier of fact. Thus, we agree with the above cited authority that the Legislature could criminalize murder of the postembryonic product without the imposition of a viability requirement. **We need not address whether different concerns might apply to an embryo.** Accordingly, to the extent K.A. Smith, supra, 59 Cal. App. 3d 751, and its progeny require a fetus to be viable in order for its murder to be prosecuted under section 187, subdivision (a), they rue the statute and should be disapproved.   So because of that wording, my interpretation of the Davis court ruling, which differs from yours, is this: a viability requirement is not a necessary element for a PC 187 murder conviction involving a the murder of a post-embryonic fetus. The application of PC 187 to an embryonic fetus --including whether that required viability, however defined-- was intentionally and explicitly *not* addressed by the Davis court. In other words, viability does not concern murder under PC 187 for a post-embryonic fetus, and they will leave it to another court will to address PC 187 in the context of an embryonic fetus.",legaladvice

My girlfriend is 18 (turning 19 in 2011) and a math student in second year in the same university.  We've been together for a year now and we've lived together for the last 4 months. People said it could be dangerous but it worked out great.  GF and I get along great. We both tend to each others needs, we split date dinners 50/50 usually (but I tend to pay more often on my own choice), we cook together, eat together, watch TV together, etc etc etc.   She has met my parents but I have not met hers. As far as this relationship could go thus far, it is fine. However, since second or third month, I knew (asked her up front) that she had no plans for a marriage or family. She says kids are annoying (babies crying, children running amok) and that she just doesn't ever feel like being tied down in a permanent relationship.  I know she doesn't flirt with other guys. Take this as a given. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if she did flirt with other guys. It's all good in this department.  All this said, what should I do? I want marriage and a family in the future (I'm looking at late 20s) but at the same time, I'm worried that if this relationship continues to last and she never wants to commit that I'll ultimately be out of my best years to find an appropriate gf (I do not mean to write this as an offensive ""treat women as objects"" way but more of a ""is there someone who might be better?"")

I looked at his phone, he had been texting an old neighbor who was a female planning on meeting up. She said something like ""do you want to be naughty or nice"" he replied ""naughty"" I did this snooping while he thought I was just playing on his phone and when I left the room before mentioning it then came back to look at it again before I brought it up he had deleted the messages.  I confronted him and he lied saying she was a lesbian and that it was an inside joke that was funny because she was a lesbian. The next time we talked about it he admitted that he lied about her being a lesbian and apologized and said that he was caught on the spot and didn't think I would believe it if he just said it was a platonic inside joke taken out of context of their whole friendship. I looked at her facebook and she does have a boyfriend. Also from the text it looks like they never ended up meeting up.  I have talked to a mutual friend about this and she had been there while my bf was talking to her bf (who is a close friend of my bfs) about it and she said that she really doesn't think he is cheating on me. I also have noticed that he is a really good person and has good character. From talking to him in the past I believe he thinks cheating is wrong. I also know that he broke up with an ex because he kissed another girl and he felt horrible about it. (at least that is his side of the story although he could have just broke up with her to be with the other girl)  I also talked to my mom about it and she said that she thinks he is a good guy and that sometimes friends joke like that and it is not necessarily sexual.  To me other than this one incident he has come off as an honest reliable guy who cares about and is really good to his friends and me and I really don't think he would go behind my back. But the message was just too suspicious to ignore.  We talked about it and he decided to delete her as a friend on facebook and to delete her phone number to make me more comfortable and because he thought about it and thought what if she was serious.  What should I do? Should I just let this one incident go since all other signs seem to indicate he is trustworthy and mutual friends say he is a good guy?

No big deal except that it came back up when we were on a trip the other weekend with a friend of hers that was out of the country with her.  We were playing the question game and I asked what the most exciting thing they had done overseas.  It was my girls turn first to answer and her friend immediately blurted out the last day overseas to which they both start cracking up.  Well I wanted in right, this is juicy.  So I asked and immediately the most awkward stone cold silence with looks of you don't want to know.  Great.  Fuck you.  I know what happened.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Bitch.  Anyway, I didn't say anything(for a while for that matter.  That shit pissed me the fuck off).  It was said without thinking and blah blah blah.  I got over it mostly and when we dropped said friend off at the airport I confirmed my suspissions(why?) and was right.  Fast forward to now, we moved and she has some collages of pictures of her overseas adventures, and since I was still bothered by it, I asked her not to put a picture of him up.  Well, she asked me who I thought it was out of her pictures and I guessed wrong, but now I can't stop obsessing over it.  I know for a fact that it is between two guys etc and I get more creepy stalkerish from there and know that she still keeps in contact with at least one of the guys and has sent pictures to him(of what I don't know).  Now, I feel the need to find out everything I can.  What were those pictures.  Are these conversations continuing under my radar?  Etc.  I don't know how to approach this reasonably.  Please halp.

c38tgj4,ndh0n,avro_lanc,"Coming from a girl who's been on both ends, I think it completely depends on your relationship, and on your approach.  Confessing your feelings for somebody who doesn't expect it always has the potential to push that person away, not just because she may feel completely differently towards you, but because she may not know where to draw the line next. I've had a guy that I'm really affectionate with (as a friend) tell me he liked me, and it made me feel like I couldn't hug him, hang out with him one on one etc. without feeling like I was leading him on.  If you're okay with the possibility that she doesn't have any feelings for you whatsoever, I think the only time I'd suggest you get your feelings off your chest is if you know that you can be comfortable with maintaining the same friendship you have already. That means letting her know that making her aware of your emotions doesn't mean that you intend to pressure her in any way, and that her hugging you, coming to you for advice (and anything else you may do) isn't going to give you the wrong idea, unless she explicitly tells you that the attraction is mutual.

cr52lxo,35i0vp,antihero17,"That used to be the justification officers used which the Supreme Court ruled is not enough to override the warrant requirement. You have a good sense for these issues so I will try to be less simplistic.  As you know, the 4th Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. This means a warrant is required for all searches and seizures absent probable cause. Beginning with Terry v. Ohio, a new standard called reasonable suspicion was created which allowed officers to seize a person (detain them) if they suspect they have committed or are going to commit a crime. The warrant requirement was also curtailed for vehicles and people traveling in vehicles based on public safety concerns and the fact that vehicles are mobile while homes are not. The other exception to the warrant requirement is exigent circumstances which includes destruction of evidence. As you rightly noticed, a person metabolizing alcohol or drugs is essentially destroying evidence. And indeed this justification allowed officers to force breath/blood tests without consent once they believed they had obtained probable cause that the person was DUI for a long time. Recently, the Court's ruling in McNeely held that the normal metabolization of drugs and alcohol in a person's system is not sufficient exigent circumstances to remove the judiciary from the process by allowing officers to not obtain a warrant. Since that ruling, officers now must obtain a warrant or point to other exigent circumstances in order to test a person's blood/breath/urine for the purposes of a DUI investigation.",legaladvice

g21yk,g21yk,,"I've been in a weird mood recently because of my relationship and was wondering if I could get some advice. (Advice from the internet, that's a laugh)  Over the last summer I started texting a guy and we hit it off, and eventually decided to go into a relationship. Since I was on break at the time, I was away from the campus where he was staying. When I went back to college after the break, we got together and he moved in with me. (I know it was quick, but that's not the issue I want to discuss)  At first it was great and we had a wonderful time together, but over the past month or so I've been thinking of him less as a partner and more of a best friend. It's coming to the point in which I think I would rather just be friends with him instead of being in a relationship.  The only issue is that I'm still not sure if that's what I want. I wish that we were just friends, but at the same time I don't want him to move out or become distant. I like being close with him, but not in the relationship setting. The other issue is that he's completely in love with me. He often tells me that I'm all that he has going for him and that he can't imagine being without me. I can't help but feel guilty that I can't return the feeling.  Am I over-exaggerating, or is it time for me to move on? This is my first relationship, and I do feel a little naive about this whole situation. The most important thing for me right now though is that if I do break it off, how can I do it without completely destroying him? I still want to be very close friends with him. Hell, I still want him to live with me, but I just don't think I want to be in a relationship anymore.  Any advice Reddit?",relationshipadvice

f8ys4,f8ys4,,"Reddit, I started dating a really beautiful girl two and a bit months ago, she is one of those precious gems who has never been interested in guys or relationships and despite both of us being 17, she has never before had a relationship.  She is amazing, she has opened up in ways I didn't think possible - you really have to picture her as one of those girls who flinched at the touch of any male; no hugs, no nothing.   We are at the stage where we both get really aroused with each other in bed, and I have slowly begun to massage her breasts and clitoris (fully clothed). We talk about our physical intimacies a lot, mainly because I have been in a serious sexual relationship before and I know how important it is to be comfortable talking about it, and she told me that she is ready to try masturbating next time we see each other.  Here comes the problem. Her mum is an over protective control freak who treats her as though she was an angel. She cornered my girlfriend and insisted on knowing how far we'd gone and she told her everything - including that we were thinking about taking it a step further.  She wasn't happy. She told her she was disgusted that she was even thinking about doing that, asking her if she wanted to be branded ""a slag"" and the like, despite the fact that well over half the girls at college, (UK), have gone as far or if not further within and outside relationships.  As a result, my girlfriend says she is now no longer happy with going further - she says that she wants to wait another month or two, which seems to me like forever.  I don't know if I can take part in a relationship where it seems as though the mother is dictating what my girlfriend should and shouldn't be doing. I love her very much, she really is amazing and something quite special, but this ordeal has been emotionally draining and I'm angry at myself for wanting to do these things so badly with her, and not being willing to wait.

We've recently realized we have feelings for each other and have been basically dating for around a month now.  This is where it gets problematic. At the time I developed feelings for him, I was trying to get over someone else that I had been in love with for a long period of time (call him J). I finally realized he was never going to love me back, etc and ended our friends with benefits thing. I personally feel that I've moved on from him, and am falling for C. But his issue is that he's unsure if I'm really over J. This was reinforced by the fact that when J and I were drunk with a group of friends on New Years, he kissed me and I kissed back more out of force of habit and because I was pretty wasted at this point. But, even my drunk mind remembers thinking ""this doesn't feel right. This isn't C"" So basically he doesn't want to date me yet because he's unsure how I feel about him, but I'm 100% confident I want to be with him and only him. He even seems too embarrassed to tell his friends that we're together, though my closest friends know.

That's her way of showing her she's not using you and saying, ""I'm not a bitch like other girls can be!""  For now on, when you make decisions to pay for her/hang alone with her/be physical with her, YOU HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT ABOUT IT. Make that decision and stick to it like you know exactly what you're doing. She says, ""I'll have to pay you back, I swear!"" You say, ""Psh. Shutup. It's no big deal."" (because you know what you're doing)  I see her playful hugging and hitting as subtle hints to get physical with you, and you're not taking the bait. And if you don't/didn't take the bait long enough, she'll give up, place you in the friend-zone, and won't have that kind of attraction to you again because you're no longer a mystery to her like you were in the beginning.   My remedy: 1) Hang alone with her in a more date-like environment-- throw her some bait back. Ask her if she wants to go see a movie (with confidence! So choose the damn movie!) ""Hey, let's go see Tron tonight! Want to?"" GOOD SIGN: ""Yeah, let's do it!"" SIGN YOU ARE FZoned: ""Sure! Who else is going?/Is [friend] going to?"" SIGN YOU ARE VERY FZoned and she knows you like her: ""Let's let [blahblah] know too!"" NEUTRAL SIGN: ""I can't because..."" ...or even better. Ask her if she wants to watch a movie at your place.  2) Start being even more obviously flirty. (Do not EXCESSIVELY compliment her- it comes off as insincere. Only do so at opportune moments...like after a shitload of teasing). Rattle off a bunch of stupid pick-up lines you know as a joke. Hug her/tickle her more often. TEASE TEASE TEASE her.    You should be looking for her reactions to all these things. Her reactions to what you throw out there are what tell you the story.   If you're still confused about things, and it's not obvious which side you're on...  3) Be blunt, open, and honest. Just ask her if she would like to go on a date. Use the word ""date."" She'll either say yes or get all weird and say she doesn't think of you in ""that way.""  If the latter, in order to KEEP the friendship you have, hide your broken heart and make it clear to her how little of a deal it is to you and continue to treat her as casually and friendly as you have ( DO NOT SHOW AN OUNCE OF AWKWARDNESS OR HURT, or it will take a shitload more work to get her to trust you with the same kind of things she was before.)",relationshipadvice

hb1lo,hb1lo,mitravelus,"Prepare for a wall of txt:  Let me start this by saying I love this girl, and in fact see wedding and children with her in the future whenever that may be.  Recently I moved back out to Fort Collins because the atmosphere in Grand Rapids was killing me. People there generally aren't the most caring or open minded. She's there for school but has lived there her whole life. We ended up talking and decided that if a relationship long distance was going to be feasible it'd have to be open.   Now I'm admittedly a lot more promiscuous than she is, attractive enough, and have a certain charm when I want to. It's not hard for me to bed a woman, and am open to more opnely sexual acts than she is. She's a bit more reserved, picky about the men she's attracted to, but she is incredibly attractive, charming, and, if the mindset was there, would have no problem getting another man.   She's never been in one and neither have I, so this is both new to us so the rules on this kinda thing are kinda being made up along the way. The one thing I asked for though was complete transparency, communicate anything that happens to either of us, including feeling about the others freedom. If only to be aware, and more so to talk about things and hash out any jealousy issues. We talk a few times a week on the phone, but it was agreed that we at least txt the event to each other when it happened or within a timely manner (like I understand passing the fuck out after a good night).  Issues have arisen because within the 2 nights after making it official I went and had 2 threesomes, thinking that I was free to do so because that's what we agreed on. Upon telling her these events she was hurt, which I almost expected seeing as she's just as new to this as I am. What's worse is that she let these feelings fester and it took me awhile to get them out of her.  So I ask you reddit, what sort of finesse do I need to apply to this to keep things running?

So try to give her some slack if she gets upset easily by something you say or do, but not to the point of her treating you badly.  I started dating my husband while he was going through a divorce, so I have been in your exact situation.  You are lucky that there are no children only in the fact that more than likely, you will not have to deal with the ex on a regular basis, which can be extremely difficult and stressful for both of you.  Unless of course they are one of those crazy, stalker-y kind, in which case.....sorry.    And, if you are lucky like I was, she is a very reasonable person and has taken from her divorce an appreciation of being treated well.  I don't think my husband would have appreciated or loved me as much had he NOT been married before.  The first marriage was with a person who he was not compatible with and who treated him pretty bad.  Because of this he tells me, all the time still, that he never wants to take me for granted because he knows how special it is to have a relationship as good as ours is.

Here's another angle after I moved my car.   http://tapatalk.imageshack.com/v2/15/02/03/63455c4106531ac2345bbc17c3772d3a.jpg  Let's take a look at all the other handicapped spots in the lot - which are CLEARLY marked with paint and signs that are centered.  http://tapatalk.imageshack.com/v2/15/02/03/273ef5e965bd059a0275151f53ff8ebf.jpg  Signs in the center of the spots - lines and paint where the signs aren't.   Other side:   http://tapatalk.imageshack.com/v2/15/02/03/f3dda31fad77b2d140079f0b50801364.jpg  Again, paint and signs in the center of every spot.   A $325 ticket for this. I mean, cmon. Who would think that this is a handicapped spot when every single other spot is clear about it?

Both ladies were on disability and had pre-existing arthritis and degeneration.    We spent 3 hours deliberating.  Fault was stipulated and all past medical was awarded.  8/10 jurors only wanted to give the plaintiffs $1000 for pain and suffering because ""that's a lot of money"".

The thing that's hard to grasp is that between ages 18-24 you change ultra drastically. You can't be told what to do, you change your mind, and life shows new meaning, there are also lots of tears.   You are two 18 years olds living similar but not identical lives. People grow unexpectedly. It would be unrealistic to think that she thinks and wants the exact same things that you do at the same time. This happens in relationships, and this is my advice:  As much as it pains you to do so, don't press her for details. Be the nice guy you claim to be. If she cheats, she cheats. But just keep being the best version of you that you can. At the end of the day YOU are not going to be the reason for failure. And that's the best you can do.   I'm 27 and have had a string of great relationships that have for many reasons. But I'm still learning. Be patient. Enjoy dating. Don't make your plans around her. Just try to live outside of the vortex of emotions that all first loves are. I wish you the best of luck, and I'm always here if you have any more questions.

du99cxf,7xjax0,JustSomeBadAdvice,"I used to work in accounting (bookkeeping really but we called it accounting) for a large grocery store chain, for several years.  One day when counting the amounts came up $500 off.  This wasn't that unusual, it happens from time to time, and generally the exact amounts off were easier to find than other counts.  It was between my lunchtime and my end-of-day count, so it was clearly on me.  I've seen people fired for less than $500 so it mattered to them.  I spent 30 minutes checking everything I usually counted and came up empty.  Called the manager (on great terms with almost all of my managers as well as the primary bookkeeper) and had him recount, and he got the same thing as I did.  We decided to leave it and the primary bookkeeper, who was stellar, would find it in the morning, so I left a note and left for the day.  The next day I came in to work for a different department after noon and asked if she had found it.  She had not, and she was unusually terse with me.  I started my work for the day and talked to a manager a little later.  He hinted that this was kind of a big deal and that loss prevention would be involved soon.  I'd never had LP involved with anything I did, and I hadn't done anything wrong, but I started to get a little worried.  I checked with the primary as she was doing her end of day count and still nothing.  I asked if I could recount myself again, and she let me, so I stopped what I was doing and started a recount.  It still came up off(correct for her, as she had already reconciled the $500 short).  I was thrown off a lot - I had done this for almost three years at this point, and nothing like this had ever happened.  And I could tell they were a treating me with some level of suspicion, which irritated me since I had done nothing wrong, except whatever mistake had caused the problem.  I stopped and thought - Where the hell could $500 exactly be?  I went through the processes in my mind and there were only three options - A fat-fingered entry into the computer, a bundle of $20's, or a big bundle of ones.  We also had exactly $500 in quarters rolls that day, but it was correct on both counts.  The fat-fingered idea was out, as it would have shown up the next day unless there was a major bug in our ancient software (OS/2 Represent!).  The ones was very unlikely - they were huge, as tall as a can of soda and we only messed with them when they arrived from the bank.  But a bundle of 20's was small and very lightweight, and we messed with them constantly as we balanced the tills.  So where could a bundle of $20's go?  I started looking around all of the little cubby holes around our feet, under the desk edge, etc.  The office we worked in had these lockable metal drawers built into the counter, which is where we kept the day's money.  We used this drawer constantly throughout the day and emptied it at night (into the safe).  These drawers were LONG, long enough to have a whole rack of $100 quarters and then another 8 inches from the front of that.  In front of my manager and the primary accountant, I pulled the drawer all the way out, far more than the 6 inches we would normally use, and looked back in it.  Far back in the back was a bundle of 20's, neatly paperclipped and rubber-banded exactly as was our habit.  The $500 was there the whole time, just at the back, pushed behind our quarters and coin trays.  If I had not found that that day, it would have randomly turned up a month or three later when someone yanked open the (empty) drawer really hard, likely after I had been fired. :P",legaladvice

5m4mgs,5m4mgs,raybans215,"Person A, who was a friend of a friend, acted as an agent to help me find an investment property. We found a property I liked from a seller, Person B (no prior relation to either of us), but we could not do a closing with a title company, because Person B had a judgment against him which was showing up on the title search for the property. Person A and B convinced me to buy the property with only a General Warranty Deed and personal guarantee from Person B stating that he would be able to secure title insurance for us 90 days after. Person B had claimed that the property was not affected by the judgment, because there was a recording error with the property.   background info: The property was purchased by Person B and then transferred to Person C in a double closing that happened some years prior to my involvement. The second closing where the property was to be transferred from Person B to Person C never got recorded by the title company and still showed Person B as the owner. Person B and C were partners at the time although they belonged to different LLCs.   Person C prepared all the General Warranty Deed and personal guarantee forms for Person B. Person B and I signed them and recorded the transaction with the recorder of deeds. A few months later, we got notice that the property was going to sheriff sale. I contacted Person A and B immediately and they assured me that they were working to resolve the issue and repeatedly told me I didn't need a lawyer. I listened.  The property sold at sheriff sale and Person C said they would file a title claim to repay me back my losses. Fast forward to the present, Person C filed a claim with the title company and received a settlement for the recording error, but we have not seen any money from it. In their complaint, there is no mention that the property was sold to me by Person B or that he and Person B were working the whole time to try and secure me title insurance on the property. It just stated that Person C lost his property in a sheriff sale as a direct result of the recording error.  Since the sheriff sale, I had filed lawsuits and got awarded judgments against Person A and B in small claims court, but Person B is no where to be found. Can I go after Person C as well? Because Person A was acting as the agent, I never actually had direct correspondence with Person C and everything I know is from what Person A told me. Person C never actually signed anything, but I do have some emails related to the property with him CC'ed on there, an email from him that was forwarded to me from Person A with a letter from the title company stating the a claim had been initiated, and some text messages between Person A and C talking about how to recover my investments. I'm not sure how much Person A will be willing to cooperate with us, especially because we did sue him, but he spoke with Person C first hand.",legaladvice

Had an undiagnosed illness (basically: constant terrible nausea) for 1.5 years, things are getting better now, however, lost all confidence and so on due to spending a year wanting to throw up all day every day (lost weight and stuff too).  So there's this girl who is in the same course as me. I see her in almost every class and i'd really like to get to know her. Thing is, since i lost all confidence (and i'm not a socially autistic person, i used to be rather outgoing with females and i still can be when around friends) i just don't know how to approach her at all. Since my class is basically static for every subject, if I fucked up it would be known rather quickly and would do my even worse to my confidence.  Even if I could talk to her, i wouldn't know what to say anymore. What should I do? A good friend i usually attend classes with knows her somewhat, but they don't really talk outside of the odd interaction here and there.  So, what? add her on facebook? Wouldn't that seem creepy with never having spoken to her in person?  I'd love for this to work since i want to get my life back on track after my illness, but that illness is still preventing me from doing things like this.  Thanks if you reply.

Backstory: I was the computer nerd who nabbed the cheerleader.  While I wasn't a respectable person (even in my own mind) in my youth, I believe I've blossomed into something considerably better than I was (I don't want to toot my own horn, but I am pretty awesome).  I'm still being treated as the lowly computer nerd by my wife, while my friends, co-workers, and strangers find me a hoot to be around.  Issue #2: my mother in law.  I floated your idea of external assistance.  The only way my wife is willing to do this is with someone from her mother's church.  Well... that ship has sailed and I am not going to subject myself to that.    Since my initial post I've spent a lot of time pondering my wife's relationship with her mother.  It's obviously complicated.  I'm not a psychologist, but there is a history of depression in the family.  They choose to focus on very negative things, such as all the wrong choices they've made in their lives - this has bled into my wife having a very negative view of her own life and choices.  What's very sad to me, is that I've identified a pattern of my wife's poor attitude towards her relationship increases the closer she is to her mother (which ebbs and tides over time).  Though I may have tried 15 years ago, I really can't compete with that.  I'm not sure where this is going to go, but Talashira, thank you for your response.",relationshipadvice

While I haven't yet lost my father, he did suffer a massive stroke a few weeks ago from which he'll probably never completely recover, and ever since then, my mind's been on nothing else.  As it is, my boyfriend has been very supportive and quiet. He doesn't pressure me for attention, even though my time with him has been cut very short and our sex life has been nonexistent since my father's stroke. He makes me aware that he realizes that this is a tough time for me and that he will be here for anything I need. He cooks me dinner, does laundry, and comes with me when I visit my family. He's never once complained. And because of it, I've felt free to deal with my feelings and my stress over the situation, which means I'll be back to normal a lot faster than if I had to deal with him pressuring me.  If I had a boyfriend who was insisting that we needed to ""work on our relationship"" when I was so devastated, I would probably react the same way your girlfriend is reacting: with anger, impatience, and frustration. I promise you that she knows that things aren't going well with you two because of this, but she simply can't care right now because she's so devastated by her father's passing.  Be quiet. Be supportive. Be self-sufficient for a while. Tell her that you're there for her. Tell her, too, that you would like her to consider seeking out professional support. It doesn't have to be a regular thing; even a single appointment with a counselor during which she can unload all her feelings can work wonders for a person.  I know it's hard, and I know you miss your girlfriend, but the harder you pull her to you, the further she's going to push you away.

Then, just to prove how retaliatory the case is--  my ex turned to my in the hallway when I was talking to friend about having to come BACK again and travel AGAIN for the case in three week. He said, ""This is just   what you get when you use people."" I just stood there kind of shocked and told him I'm not allowed to talk to him because of the TRO he has on me.

c1l1ccy,fwigi,RockandaHardplace,"Alternate account for this, I'm so embarrassed I can't even use my regular anonymous online identity for this.   It's been over three months since she broke up with me. She did it with an email two days after by birthday, when she told me she couldn't want to see me after being apart for over three months.  She was, and I guess still is, the first girl I've ever loved.  She says it was her, not me. To spare you the details it most definitely was her, she had her issues and after impassioned question on my part (Confused puts my situation lightly) she finally revealed her reason for breaking up with me is because she didn't want me to have to deal with those issues.   My point to her was that I knew about her issues and I didn't care, I still loved her. She knew all about this during our relationship, we had talked about it (she brought it up under a different guise, it wasn't a break up conversation). She still insists she didn't want me to have to deal with it.   I don't know what to think. I still talk to her, and when I talk to her I'm happy. As soon as she's gone I feel terrible again.   I've asked her if she thinks we might have a future, and her response is ""Time will tell."" What I have to ask is, ""What will time tell me I don't already know?"" I know how I feel about her, I don't love her but when my mind wanders late a night and I start thinking of her and I together, it's the only time I smile anymore that doesn't feel forced.   I can't bring this up with her, but not talking to her about it is killing me. We were good friends, we could talk about anything. We made sense together, we were happy. I was happy. I'm not happy anymore. I just pretend because I'm so embarrassed being so broken up by this. I'm afraid people will think less of me if I'm honest about this. I'm a 21 year old guy for crying out loud. I live in a world where the best advice I can get from my peers is ""Quit being a bitch"" and I'm too embarrassed to go to my best friend of 15 years. I don't want to bother him with my shit.   The worst is when I start feeling like I'm bother her. It's not just that I want to talk to somebody cool and interesting, I want so badly to tell her how I really feel. She thinks I'm over it, and that I'm happy being friends. The fact of the matter is that I'm not over it, and I'm not happy being friends.  I feel like I'm trapped, like I have no real options. School work is piling up and I'm loosing the motivation to get any of it done. Even with my professors granting me extensions when I feel like I have too much on my plate, I still can't concentrate on my work with her going through my head.   I've always felt like the point of life is to be happy, do work, and keep having fun. I'm not happy, my work is slipping, and I can only ever really smile when I think of she and I having fun together.

17memb,17memb,2hris,"A little background:   Mm I'm 22, and my ex (it feels really fucking weird to say that)  just broke up with me yesterday (technically). We had been going out for 3 years 3 months and 1 week to be exact. We both go to the same college and she is about to graduate this spring and I am here for 3 semesters including this one. Then about 2 months ago she cheated on me. She of kissed another guy and she told me about the it the next day and was very sorry it happened. I ended up forgiving her under certain restrictions. And it seemed to work. Until today.     So we haven been texting each other basically every day for our entire relationship. So this morning she texted me and said she was up all night because she had a lot to think about. I asked her if it was about us and she said yes, and that we would talk about it later today after class. So I went to her house fearing the worst and I was right, she broke up with me. I had a hunch this would be the case because it was very odd how she was acting. She told me she wasn't happy. I asked why and she said I didn't make her feel special, i wasn't romantic enough, and I never listened to her in conversations and that she wanted to break up. While some of it may be true, I don't think it was as bad as she said it was and I tried to say that I didn't think this was an end to our relationship and that I could work on paying more attention to these things and that I legitimately not aware that she was that upset with our relationship. This break up really hit me like a ton of bricks and did not see it coming. She listened to what I said but cried a lot and said she didn't want to try anymore. We held each other while laying on her bed the whole time and I told her I didn't want to let go because I feared this was the last time I would hold her like that.   I am really devastated and feel like I never had a fair chance at fixing problems we had in the relationship. I know I haven't been the best boy friend in the world but I don't think it's fair to dump me without any chance after 3 years of this relationship.

njq96,njq96,Aruza,"18 M, my girlfriend of 6 months broke up with me early November. I was doing alright for awhile, then this happened.   First, let me tell you about the relationship. We met on Omegle of all places. I was just trolling people and I met her, she was pretty cool the entire time, and I found out she was female and she wanted to talk to me more after we finished. I was like ""what could go wrong?"" being a lonely guy I was like ""sure, we can be friends!"" We exchanged phone numbers and started texting eachother, later mailing each-other art and poems and such. Note: I live in the Mid-west, and she lives on the west coast. Before I knew it we were in a relationship and skyping all the time, even getting a little dirty, but that's not important. We talked about actually meeting a lot, and one day I realized that if I saved all the money from my crappy job for a month and a half I could afford to go see her late summer.   So I did that, I flew out and we spent her birthday together. We spent the entire 4 days or so together, we went and saw the sights, all the major touristy stuff, and a lot of other local stuff. We spent time with her friends, and of course sexy-time, which only consisted of oral and hand work. We were both virgins at the time and didn't get condoms until it was too late and we couldn't actually have sex.  I flew back and we talked occasionally. I took awhile picking out a gift for her to mail with my next letter, and she freaked out and said I didn't love her anymore, I assured her I did and asked why she was saying this. She didn't tell me why at the time.  Everything seemed better. Then College application time came. This is where it pretty much was over. Prior to this, the plan was for her to go to a specific college in Los Angeles, and then I could move there and go to community college before transferring somewhere else to finish. But college apps are stressful and she saw all the colleges she could apply to and didn't want to limit herself to Los Angeles nor did she want to leave me behind if I were to move to LA. So she went with the former, and said we shouldn't move in together, and said we should just be friends with benefits should I ever be in town.  Then, November. She kept talking about spending time with her ex-boyfriend. Her ex-boyfriend who goes to college 80 miles away. Her ex-boyfriend who was completely emotionally unavailable. Her ex-boyfriend who threatened to end the relationship if she ever discussed her feelings, never attended any of her numerous concerts or public events, and didn't talk to her after his inattentiveness/abusiveness drove her to attempt suicide, twice. She even spent a few days in a mental institution her parents were so scared she might try it again. She was spending every weekend with this guy, I forbid it, and she refused to listen to my opinion, so I refused to talk to her (which was a mistake, I admit). A week later I texted her back, wanting to talk to her, I had waited long enough. She said that when i stopped talking to her, someone else did. She had moved on and wanted nothing to do with me.  The guy she was spending the time with? Yeah, that's the guy she is now in a relationship with.  Should I be happy I'm away from this crazy bitch, or concerned for her mental and physical health. Being her ex-boyfriend who still has feelings for her, she obviously won't listen to me.  What should I do?",relationshipadvice

I 100% did not do that but they're going to drag that into arbitration as well, hence the potential costs. It's difficult and costly to prove a negative.  I have spoken to a couple very good lawyers and they have basically said that given my old employer's pattern of behaviour and vindictiveness, they can and will abuse the system to make any arbitration lengthy and costly. And yes, as @waywardsparrow suggested, they actually *are* asserting a right of setoff (which they do not have).  I also brought up Finra/SEC to these lawyers and they said it's unlikely they will care because a) it's such a small matter and b) it's cloaked in an employment dispute.

qcawg,qcawg,i_made_a_throwaway,"I met this wonderful girl back in highschool... i wasnt exactly quite the looker back then, but we grew older, and i got slightly less ugly. We graduated high school, and went our separate ways. I met her again freshman year of college, and at this point we started to go out(both 21 now)   I found out that she had recently gotten out of a relationship, and she was my first girlfriend, so naturally i had my self esteem issues. I for some reason continued to have these doubts about our relationship throughout our time together, but we still made it work. Summer of 2011 we broke up and it crushed my little heart. I always did so much for her, and she wanted to break up with me. I wasnt exactly able to be the best bf since she was my first gf and i was inexperienced.  That entire summer i worked and slowly forgot about my ex.As sophomore year rolled around we stated talking again. I admitted i missed her, and she basically went along with it.  I guess she was lonely as well and that's why we got back together, or so i thought.  After a conversation with her sister, i found out she liked someone else and only saw me as a friend.This devastated me. I asked her about what she thought of me, and she responded just that...""only as a friend"". Idk why, but i continued to fall more in love with this girl the more i hung out with her.  We enjoy all the time we spend together. She always has fun when we go out together and we never argue. She never seems to mention any other guy, nor do i see her acting suspicious. She texts and calls me daily.  Her birthday rolled around and im planning to throw her a surprise bday party this week. Her friend bluntly told me one day that im being too nice to her. For someone who just see's you as a friend i do too much for her. SHe is right.. i always try to do my best to please her, and the only attempt she made to do anything special for me was get me a sweater for my birthday in December...my birthday is in august...she claimed it to be a belated birthday present. Her friend, who is also my friend, says that she doesnt want to see me hurt and that i should put so much effort into making her happy... that i should get the fantasy that we would ever get back together again.   Although i hate to think about it, she is right, i make such an effort for nothing in return. The list to leave her outweighs the list to stay and please her. I think that i should throw her the party, and leave for good and say my goodbyes politely. I know that she doesnt want to loose me as a friend, but i cant stand to stay with her seeing as how it hurts me more  TL;DR: Fell in love with my hs sweetheart.Went out for a year, broke up, friendzoned, and now cant stand to be with her since she doesnt love me as much as i love her.

c2uz7j6,lqatf,lawnessd,"Why are you two texting over arguments?  This is silly.  I've been with my girlfriend for a month now.  It's not long, but that's irrelevant.  At the beginning of the summer, I started working for an attorney in town who says the word ""cunt"" all the time.  I never really used that word, unless I'm quoting a George Carlin routine.  Nonetheless, I began using it here and there.  I don't use it frequently, but occasionally I do.  When I started seeing this girl, we talked about deal breakers.  We were obviously very interested in each other, so I just wanted to know whether it would be worth seeing where things went.  After all, we don't want to be caught with our pants down months or years from now, realizing that one of us cannot get over something the other person's unwilling to change.  ""Deal Breakers.""  In addition to deal breakers, there are things that we really don't like.  I asked her about hers, and vice versa.  She told me she didn't like the word ""cunt.""  Understandable.  She wasn't just talking about me calling her that, but she said she didn't like it in general.  Fair enough.  That's not a big deal.  Since then, I've said it once (maybe twice) in front of her.  I wasn't thinking about it, and as I was on some slightly-funny rant about something probably irrelevant, it came out.  As soon as it came out, I sorta swallowed, dropped my voice, and - I don't know, realized what I was saying.  It was like, ""lick her cunnntttt errrmumbleerrr I'm sorry, that just came out.""  I apologized immediately, told her I didn't mean that in any derogatory way, and that I love her beautiful pussy (which I hadn't even seen or touched at that time, which made it somewhat funny).  She just looked at me and said, ""that's all right.""  I apologized even more genuinely, gave her a hug to let her know I care, and she just sorta giggled and said, ""it's okay, really.""  She wasn't saying it's okay to use that word all the time.  She doesn't.  But she saw that I genuinely cared and was trying not to say it.  That's what a relationship is about.  Caring about what the other person thinks.  If he doesn't care about you not liking the word ""faggot,"" than ditch his sorry, apathetic ass.  You'll find someone who may habitually say the word because it's hard to break single-person-habits like saying certain words.  He'll say that, apologize immediately, hug you, care about you, apologize again, and you'll say the same thing, ""It's okay, you're sweet.  Thank you!!""  Additionally, if he's in his twenties and unwilling to talk about an issue like this over the phone, speak actual words, or communicate at all, then ditch his sorry ass.  Alternatively, if you don't know how or aren't willing to communicate without texting - if you can't actually call him up or see him in person, tell him you're kinda upset with him, ask him if he cares, etc., then I guess he's what you deserve.",relationshipadvice

ii4yq,ii4yq,,"My GF and I have been dating for about 2 years and we moved in together about 3 months ago. We're both in our early 30's and have both been living on our own for many years. I've been on my own for about 10 years and she's been on her own for 4 years.     We seem to be having trouble with dealing with housework. I also have a hard time speaking with her about things that she does because anytime I mention something, she immediately gets defensive.  Some examples of things I have mentioned are below:    * leaving dishrag on counter in a wet ball * not stacking the dishwasher properly (so that the dishes get washed) * not washing dishes properly by hand (last batch had oily residue all over it) * not locking up the doors and windows when she is the last one downstairs      The last point was what really angered me. I was upstairs listening to a lecture online for my certifications and she was downstairs. She came up to the bedroom, had a shower and got into bed to read. When I came to say goodnight, I asked her if she had locked up downstairs. She gave me this blank look and said, ""no."".  I asked her ""why not?"" and she immediately got defensive and said that if I was going to make rules about locking up, I should inform her. I, in turn, got pissed off because:    a) I feel that it's common sense to lock the house before you go to bed b) She seemed to think that I'm supposed to go back downstairs and do the lockup before I come to bed.    c) We had had a conversation about locking the window the previous day.       I also feel that she's not acting like she lives with another person or a 'significant other'. She has a routine and she can't seem to deviate from that. When she comes home, she jumps on her laptop to surf and is so focused that she can't hear when I'm asking her something or talking. It's really annoying when I'm trying to BBQ dinner for the both of us and I could use some help, but she is zoned out on her laptop.     Now, she also does stuff. She's not lazy, but she does it on her own schedule. She sweeps, cleans the bathrooms when they need cleaning, cleans the kitchen after using it, etc. She's also not a bad person, but I am feeling more and more streessed out over the amount of stuff I have to do in regards to the house and now I feel like I have to go behind her to do stuff like re-wash her dishes and check up on downstairs.     I guess What I really want to know is how to approach all this with her. She gets extremely defensive and doesn't like to be told how to do something. My problem is that the way she's doing things isn't working out. I also need to know how to approach her with this laptop issue. She can't keep zoning out like that. It's bad now, but it's going to be dangerous if we have kids.   ...I guess I'm also asking if I'm in the wrong in any way. Maybe I just have to do more work than her?

Visine is pretty instant, I'd argue faster than food poisoning. It will be hard to detect in a sample with just a few mLs needed for those types of effects, stool sample will be key.

But the funny thing is, I found that 1% a couple of times, but they wanted open relationships or were bisexual and had to have a woman on the side now and then or had other issues going on that I couldn't deal with (at least at the time). The really stereotypical women that I seem drawn to, the womanly ones with the girly girl shoes and hips and whatnot, they're the hardest to deal with in this regard :/ All except for one in my past who I let go of (long story). :/  /sigh, this probably won't end well",relationshipadvice
cxhkag3,3uswhf,litmustest1,"&gt;In your opinion how much in attorney fees would it be worth to fight a misdemeanor?  No idea.  Call a few criminal defense attorneys around town and ask.  Many offer free consultations.  If I were to just guess, I'd estimate somewhere around $2000-$3000 without a trial; more than that if you go to trial.  &gt;How much damage can this charge cost us if we choose to just pay the fine?  Paying the fine usually involves admitting guilt.  At a minimum, that would be a misdemeanor entry on your criminal record that would come up on any future background check.  Because it involves domestic violence, there could be other consequences like limitation on gun ownership.  This is why it's imperative to get a full understanding of the situation from an attorney.  Additionally, 9 out of 10 criminal cases end in some sort of plea bargain.  With alternatives such as diversion (charges dropped and no prosecution if you satisfy the terms of a court ordered probation), reduction of the charge to some other non-criminal infraction, or outright dismissal, there's really no benefit to you at this early stage to pay the fine and plead guilty.  Just to be clear, this is disorderly conduct as defined in Wisconsin statute 947.01, and not some local, municipal code, right?",legaladvice

I would miss out one helping with homework, etc., and be stressed trying to get groceries, laundry etc., like every other single working mom in the world.

ihccc,ihccc,thisllbemythrowaway,"I’ve been dating a guy for almost three years now. It hasn’t been easy for the majority of the time mainly because we have totally different relationship ‘styles.’ I am very warm and affectionate; he is not at all. I crave intimacy and romance; he is not romantic in the least. Anyway, we’ve worked very very hard to meet one another halfway because we both agree that what we do have in common is worth working for. So about 4 or 5 months ago, I found out he was in contact with his ex. We’d had a fight and didn’t speak for a few days and he apparently thought it would be okay to send her very sexual texts and she did the same in return. He said things to her that he would never say to me. I found out about it and confronted him and he admitted that it was stupid and wrong and he was sorry, etc. I don’t know why, but I didn’t break up with him and chose instead to work through it. It’s been so hard. I keep seeing those texts in my mind and thinking about the nerve he had to send them behind my back. So this past weekend I was using the camera on his phone. I opened the folder to look at the picture and up pops a picture of his naked erect penis. It came up as a draft as if he were sending it to someone. I turned the phone to face him and said, ‘Who is this meant for?’ Note, that he has never sent me a picture like that. If I asked, he would probably laugh in my face. He was speechless for a second and then sort of said, ‘I think you know who it was for.’ And told me that it was from back when he was texting his ex and that he’d never sent it and he didn’t know why it popped up like that on his phone. I was shaking and furious. I walked out of his place fully motivated to dump him. I was so disgusted by it – I just didn’t think he was that kind of person. So I went home and cried and then, being the weakling that I am, ended up calling him later that night saying I wanted to come over and work it out. I know I shouldn’t have; to most people, that’s an unforgivable offense. I just wonder if I’m so afraid of being lonely that I can’t muster the courage to break up with him.

So I'm thinking im totally done. But shes still flirting with me like mad!  Nothing happens again! I am totally confused and feel demasculated for not having made anything happen.  Well next time I see her, she is totally giving me signals AGAIN, in fact we ended up doing some serious cuddling and holding hands! Have I just been friend zoned?  or even worse... become a fucking cuddle buddy? I want to bone this girl and hopefully hang out with her more! But she won't stop teasing me!!  (btw, I think maybe part of the reason there may be a chance I am not completely friend-zoned, is that I only see her once every few months, and she or I will just happen to be at the same place because we have mutual friends. When she sees me she is always suuuper stoked, and I have NEVER seen her leave with another guy.)",relationshipadvice

Has she been able to talk to her landlord? These things are happening on their property and if she is being harassed or terrorised, the property company can probably take steps.   Get a motion-activated camera that records everything. Have one for the front and back of her property. If she gets a spot in front of her unit for parking, make sure one is aimed there too. Those cameras are inexpensive. If you are nearby, and these things always happen around the same time/date, maybe you or other family members could stay with her.

Are the texts deleted from her phone also or are you able to see them and know for sure that 'nothing has happened'?  If the phone bill is in your name you can get a list of the actual texts sent and received, but it may require a subpoena.   If she is behaving this way now, how did she behave about the kiss? Was it blamed on alcohol, emotional distance between the two of you, her dog dying, etc?  Sounds like a repeating pattern of behavior to me and you should let her know you won't deal with it and kick her to the curb. Then you get to see if she will actually admit fault and try and get you back. If not then you are better off without her.  This comes from a guy whose significant other had an emotional affair over the internet, but came clean and admitted her fault when I caught and confronted her.

So she had been going out after work for drinks while I was at home cause of work the next day. We had a few fights over it but ultimately I told her I understand why she was doing it asked her to cut back on it. When she brought up going on a break she said she felt guilty about how she was treating me and that I just didnt understand what she was going through so I can't help. I believe her intentions were good but I did not and still don't want it to be the end of us. We still live together because our lease is only a few months from expiring. We see eachother a lot but don't kiss or anything like that, but other than physically touching we act the exact same. Usually on weekend we do our own things with our friends and don't talk much.

izhhz,izhhz,,"Okay, I'm sorry, but I had to ask reddit.  My boyfriend (of 9 months) and I were together late one one night and his ex called. It was 2am. We had already had some issues over this ex in the past, and I felt that it was inappropriate to answer the phone that late while we were together. He then told me that 2am is just the time that they talk. So I just asked him, that please, if we are together and it is that late to not answer the phone right then and just call her back when he gets home. I figured it was a simple request: If it's late, and we're together, just wait until he gets home to call her back. I just thought it was a bit inappropriate or disrespectful to do it in front of me, especially because he knows we've had issues over her in the past...but if he is not with me and he's on his own time he can talk to her whenever, I don't mind. But, he completely refused, saying it was unfair and made no sense. He tried to find some deep meaning for me asking this, like that I was afraid that he was cheating on me or that I didn't trust him. Really, I just see it as inappropriate. Am I in the wrong here? I don't understand why it is difficult.  tl;dr - My boyfriends ex called at 2am and he answered. I asked him that if we are together and it is that late that in the future to please just wait until we aren't together. He refuses and says it is unfair. Am I in the wrong?  edit - The phone conversation wasn't very long. Probably no longer than 5 minutes. Also, later the next day, she called him, and told her the whole issue (because it turned into an argument). I also feel that that was disrespectful, yes?",relationshipadvice

Then she gets tired (again? lol) and I tell her she should just rest in my bed - so we both get in it, end up cuddling all night. Apparently she has never done this before / never had a bf - her main concern was that her dad would call and I would pick up (sort of preposterous). We stay up until 5am, she was wrapped around me the whole time. Clothes stayed on. If I had to describe it, it was an intimate, but non-sexual night. I drop her off the next day.   I have not seen her since, she's gotten busy (probably somewhat legit with this new very busy job), even on the weekends. She does text me from time to time. She's a nice girl, but at this point, I just need an answer, one way or another (preferably moving forward).   I tell myself I shouldn't play games with txt messaging or whatnot, so I don't but should I? Fuck everything about this.     Questions.  1. What is going on?  2. Move on?",relationshipadvice

ibnd6,ibnd6,poisheitetty,"Throwaway account, etc.  This has likely already been asked a time or ten, but I'm having real trouble meeting people, or rather, figuring out where to meet them. Preferably those of the fairer gender, but truth be told, I'd be glad to meet any sort of new, interesting people to hang out with.  I'm a guy in his early twenties, for context. My days, as they currently are, are mostly ""go to work at nine, (occasionally browse Reddit), get out from work at 5, maybe go out to a bar's terrace for a drink if the weather's nice (been a hot, hot summer so far here), then... go home and foreveralone on Reddit and IRC"". I live in Finland, and as you may know, Finnish people are pretty reticent and introverted (lest copious amounts of alcohol are introduced to the equation, but I wasn't really planning on that for this), so it'd feel just... *wrong* to for instance go sit at another table at the aforementioned terrace and strike up a conversation... And even so, I wouldn't know what to talk about.  I think there'll be a suggestion to start a new hobby, but okay - what hobby? I'm not, let us say, very athletic (not a landwhale though, just a little on the stockier side), so I wouldn't very well feel at home doing anything of that ilk. And even so, there's still the same issue - striking up a convo with strangers.  I have no trouble interacting with my friends and other people I know, though -- it's just about how to turn strangers into acquaintances or even, le gasp, friends (or, well... in the best case, in the case of a member of the ladyfolk, something more).

c348c9v,msgkx,Infamous_Misquoter,"&gt; I’m afraid of falling into the ‘friend zone’, and thus want to make a move relatively soon, and make my intentions clear.  What are you looking for exactly? Sounds to me you are looking for ""a"" relationship in general rather than ""a relationship with her"" specifically. Making a ""move"" is all fine and dandy but you have to be honest with yourself on what you want out of this.   Typically making moves indicates an intention to score rather than to build something; but this might just be ill-chosen words. So rather, let me ask you directly a couple of questions (and no need to answer these questions on here, just answer them honestly in your head):  * are you looking to score or do you want to be with her?  * Do you know her outside of your shared interests?  * Does she know you?  * Can she  say that she can honestly know she wants to be with you on what she knows of you? Would you trust her on this and feel it is legitimate or would you always carry a nagging doubt? What would you think her answer to this question might be? * You feels she has expressed interest, are YOU interested in her?  * Why are you afraid of essentially becoming friends with a girl? (Practically speaking ladies make awesome wing""men"" and often help you get introduced to other awesome ladies. In general, making a friend is pretty awesome, regardless of their capacity to insert your penis into them [fun tip: most if not all friends are plug-and-play]). * Is there something more going on your side of the equation here?   Think about these questions.   If you do mutually admit to being interested in one another, don't forget to talk about what each of you expect out of a relationship. *Mutual interest is just the first step.*  Sorry if I'm shuffling your cards here. :P",relationshipadvice
l46gi,l46gi,,"We're both 23, have been dating for 4 months now. I knew from the start of the relationship that she was still friends with one of her exes. It never really bothered me that much until she told me on day that she still had feelings for him, but she also said that our feelings are much stronger. She pretty much stopped hanging around him about two months in to the relationship. On a side note, we have always wanted to do shrooms together. (juvenile, I know, but oh well) She finally found some, but we're in a financial bind and can't afford them. (she owes me close to a thousand dollars) She owes me this much because we live together and put all the groceries / expenses on my card until the end of the month.  She texts me a few days ago asking if I would be okay if she went and did shrooms with her ex. I've already told her before that I'm very uncomfortable with them spending time together now, and I told her that again. She said she was reconsidering it, but now she is planning on doing them with him tonight. When she told me, I was fucking furious. I was in class at the time, and found it impossible to concentrate afterwards. I ended up skipping two other lectures and coming home.  I've been livid since she first told me she wanted to do them with him, but this pushed me over the edge. Am I just being a jealous douche, or am I justified? I'm considering ending the relationship over this.",relationshipadvice
mffmt,mffmt,stuckandstuff,"Alright, so this is my situation. This was my first real relationship. I dated a guy this spring, but he was a senior in college, while I was a freshman (for some strange reason, almost all the people I hung out with were seniors, so the relationship made sense). Unfortunately he graduated, I live and study here on the west coast, and he got a position with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps on the east coast for the year. I visited him during the summer before he left, which was so wonderful, but we had to say goodbye for the last time in July. Even though we love each other very much, we decided to not do a long distance relationship because I wouldn't be able to see him for a year at least, and then once his year is up I'll be studying abroad for a semester (so it would more likely be a year and a half until I could see him again). Also, he's previously had a bad breakup after a lengthy LDR, so we decided this was pretty much not for us.   This goodbye was really hard on both of us. I want SO BADLY to be with him again, but its not physically/geographically feasible. We still wanted to remain in contact, so we decided to still talk all the time and skype a few times a week. My problem is that I've come to rely on talking to him so much, it makes me so sad or insecure when we have to postpone or miss skyping on a day we've agreed on. He's helped me get through (and continues to help me with) some crippling loneliness that I'm dealing with. Remember all those senior friends I made? Well, just about all of the people I knew graduated. Yes, I know, I wasn't thinking ahead when I decided to hang out with mostly seniors. I have one good friend still, but I'm a social person who has always had a good group of friends in my life, but now I just feel helpless to make new friends.   So basically, I'm sad all the time. And my guy (maybe call him Matt?) has helped me through all of this. When we were together I helped him through some serious depression (his mental health is still not all better, so I worry from time to time about how he's doing, but so far he's been just fine). However now I get super anxious about us talking, and I try not to but I end up coming off as clingy EVEN THOUGH we're not in a relationship! We keep it to a minimum, but we still sometimes say I love you to each other, and we send each other things in the mail occasionally. And we talk every day, whether that's through texting or a phone call or skyping. His job and his community life sometimes makes it so he can't talk very much for a little while, and it makes me so stressed out sometimes. He has been so understanding and wonderful, he never gets annoyed with me, even when I cry a lot. He tells me that he really does care about talking to me, but he's never been a very demonstrative guy so for some reason I just can't reassure myself with what he says. I'm a pretty emotional person, and he isn't showing on the surface like I do, even though I know he cares and still loves me. Also, I'm so scared of ruining what we have left. Nothing is broken between us, and I want it to stay that way, but with the crazy anxious way I'm acting I'm afraid that's what I'm going to do.  My need to talk to him a lot is making me frustrated and sad, and after our last skype time on monday (during which I cried and basically whined about missing him and wanting to talk to him), I asked him yesterday if we could try not talking for a while. I really want to hit the reset button, and just calm down about everything. I need to stop equating him talking with me with him loving me. We're going to go 2 weeks with basically no contact, and I'm hoping it will give me the perspective and realization that we are really no longer in a relationship. I have no idea whether we'll ever have the chance to be together again. We both said to each other that its important to not feel constrained, and we should be free to date other people. Its so depressing to think about that though. I'm certainly not avoiding men, and if someone nice asked me out, I would definitely do it. I almost feel like I won't be able to be sane again until I've experienced what its like to date someone else.   I need to stop asking for reassurances from him. I need to stop clinging to the times when we talk. I need to stop wanting to be in his life a lot. I guess I just need to vent, and I'm especially stressed because I'm out of contact with him right now. Breaking up, when neither of us wants to, really sucks.  edit: just wanted to clarify, I usually get anxious if I'm only able to get one text a day from him, or if we have to postpone or have a really short skype conversation.   Also, sorry this is so long!! I needed to vent.",relationshipadvice
i85k3,i85k3,relationshipstruggle,"(repost; moved from askreddit to relationshipadvice)  I'm best friends with my ex girlfriend. She has a serious boyfriend of 3+ years. Before that, we used to date long distance for 3 years, talking for 2-3 hours a day. Before that, we were best friends (a total now of 10 years). We have a lot of history. She's a significant part of my life. But here's the problem, we talk on average about 20-30 minutes a day, and sometimes skype for hours. I have such a strong emotional attachment to her still. It basically seems like were still dating, except I don't fly over to have sex with her.  Now, If I had a serious girlfriend, I wouldn't be as alarmed... But I don't. I have not had a serious relationship since her.. And its really starting to bother me. Don't get me wrong, I have hooked up with other girls, some even better looking then my ex, but find myself so emotionally connected to my ex that it's leading me to (presumably) not get over her and not be able to find anyone else..  Should I stop talking to her, at least tone it down until I have a new girlfriend I genuinely care about? I deeply care about my ex, but if I stop talking to her she'll feel like I'm ruining a great friendship.",relationshipadvice

g03bj,g03bj,,"So this is a bit of a **looooong** story….I’m posting this because I feel like I might finally have a chance at a great relationship and not messing it up…I need some perspective.   Basically, in the past years I've been in several relationships and I have played a large role in why they have not worked out except for the first one.  I'm not going to sugar coat it...I've been a real asshole to several women that simply didn’t deserve to be hurt the way I hurt them.  About a year ago I decided to just forego being involved with any women and try to focus on myself.  (I had typed out a detailed account of about 2 pages of how I successfully sabotaged my previous relationships but decided it was simply too much to include here)  I guess part of the reason for this post is I obviously still feel some guilt for what I did in the past.   Well now jump to Feb 2011, I’m going about my usual new routine: working, hanging out with friends, spending time doing things I love…just having a good time in general and not hurting anyone.  During these 9 months I had also recently opened up a FB acct again….well sometime in the last week of Feb I get a friend request from a girl I had been acquaintances with throughout high school.  We never talked much, just hi and bye….though she was good friends with some of my good friends.  I didn’t think much of it and just accepted.  A week later I was at a friend’s house, getting things ready for a get together we were having that night.  I log into FB and see that she’s online; an internal battle ensues: *“Do I say hi to her?  Will she think I’m a creep? Shit what do I do?!?”*  My friend comes up behind me and says *“Dude **just say ‘hi’**…it works.”*    To my surprise we ended up having a great conversation and hit it off pretty well…I invited her to our get together that night and to my even greater surprise she came over, we had a very chilled out conversation and well pretty much just enjoyed each others company.  For the next week we hung out with each other almost every day…we clicked very well…we both share very similar interests.  Needless to say, these past weeks have been nothing short of amazing; it’s very evident that we are both very into each other.    I guess a part of me is afraid that I will fuck this up like I have in the past…and for very small instants, I have found myself almost regressing to my previous needy and insecure methods.  Thankfully, I have placed an immediate stop to them; I’ve learned (the hard way) that women simply do not find insecurity and clinginess attractive at all…if anything those are surefire ways to make women avoid you and leave you in the dust.  More importantly, I am sure that I will not allow myself to make the same mistakes that cost me my relationships in the past (being a dick, not giving enough attention, etc).  I feel like I have much more control over myself now, and even though at times I don’t know what she’s thinking, I feel confident that she wants this to turn into something long term.  Part of me feels that karma is going to bite me in the ass and I’ll end up hurt for all the shitty things I’ve done in the past.  This has got to be the first girl I have dated whom I have not “stolen” from anyone or jumped into dating straight from another relationship.  She got out of a really bad relationship about 4 months ago…but it has been a clean break and there is no gray area about it; they have been done for 4 months.      This girl is such a great person, loves her family, is extremely beautiful (and surprisingly humble about it) and is just all around an excellent, great and caring person.  I feel like I’m really falling hard for her, and I get the same vibe from her.  I’ve handled things in a very very calm manner; I’ve let matters take their own course and at their own pace; so far it’s working well (as opposed to my old insecure, control freak tendencies).  It’s been difficult to draw the line between being thoughtful, nice etc. from being overbearing, overly sappy etc (Like I used to be at times).  To be quite honest I’ve been playing it on the VERY safe side, holding back about 70% of the sappy comments that come to my mind (my past self would not have held back, lol)...and even then I think I’ve done well in making it clear to her that I really like her and want to keep this going.  It’s been quite a while since I’ve been in a real relationship so at times I don’t really know how or even if certain things should be talked about.  I guess more than anything I’m still getting a feel of how open she is about different matters.  Granted this relationship is still in its very early stages…I may be over-thinking things and over worrying myself.  Truly letting go of the control freak personality has proven to be a trying battle…though I think I am making good progress.  As I said before, I feel like for some reason this may not work out.  This girl is waaaay out of my league, and in case you’re wondering I’m referring to her way of being, and just how much of a great person she is, not necessarily looks…and yes I have made it a point to never express that kind of insecurity to her…I know that kind of behavior would only work against me and not flatter her at all.  I just really hope things continue on the course that they are.  As I stated in the beginning, I feel like this is the first chance I’ve had in a while to do things the right way and finally be productive in a healthy relationship.  If any of you have any advice or commentary, I would greatly appreciate it.  This woman is driving me nuts. (In a good way, lol)   Thanks for reading.   --------------------------------------------------------------  ** *EDIT1** - I realize I contradicted myself in saying that I was a needy and clingy person, and then stated that I was a dick/didnt give enough attention to the relationship.  Basically, I was first a dick, then became needy/clingy, then became a dick again.  --------------------------------------------------------------   **tl;dr:** *I used to be a mentally retarded platypus from space and fucked up a lot of relationships.

On the other hand, I've never been as unsatisfied with my job, I feel lonely all the time and it's reinvigorated some repressed feelings I had for her.  Some background: we dated for 3 years in high school, broke up when we went to different colleges and hooked up on and off since then. I was really hung up on her for the vast majority of college, it was pretty painful when she would get a bf and whatnot. After school finished I finally started seeing someone else and we got pretty serious. We had to break it off because of diverging life paths, though. During this time, I spoke to my HS ex sparingly because it would feel like I was cheating if I talked to her too much. Other than that and a few other bumps, we've maintained our friendship this whole time and we talk a lot, nearly daily.    Now I get tinges of jealousy when she goes on a date or there's a prospect of her meeting a new single guy. It'll put me in a funk for a few days. I miss having her around. It's frustrating and I'm frustrated that I still feel this way after this many years. I vascillate between that and rationalizing (one of my favorite pastimes) that whatever she does doesn't really effect me on a day-to-day basis, she's over a thousand miles away.  P.S.

This restriction does not prohibit an act of a public official or public employee in the performance of that person's duties or prohibit the performance by any nonlicensee of other services involving the use of accounting skills, including the preparation of tax returns, management advisory services, and the preparation of financial statements without the issuance of reports.  **Section 40-2-200:**  &gt; A person or firm who knowingly violates a provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.  In short, it's possible that *both* coworkers are on the hook for $10,000 and a year in prison for *each* return filed. The husband certainly is, and the wife may be, depending on 1) whether she knew or should have known (it seems obvious that she did know) and 2) whether she could act as a principal at an accounting firm.

I probably stopped breathing for a good time when I first saw her. I didn't even care about the party any more because for me there was only this one girl.

64o4h3,64o4h3,PM__ME__YOUR__TOES,"Let me elaborate on this. I've been in my hometown in CT recovering from surgery the past week. I'm 22 years old. I'm currently living in Baltimore though. I had an argument with my father in my room on Saturday, which escalated to us yelling at each other quite loudly. My sister, who is severely mentally ill, lives in my parent's basement and heard arguing. She also heard me yell ""I hate what she does to this family"" ""She's ruining our lives"" etc etc (that's a whole other story, but let me avoid details for the sake of brevity here.) She knew the argument was about her even though she was in the basement.   My father basically tells me ""Fuck you"" and to go back to Baltimore. He goes back to his room and goes into bed. I storm out of my room, walk through the hallway, and into the kitchen where I grab the first object I see on the table and throw it at the floor. It happened to be a cutting knife, which slid across the floor and landed right in front of the basement door. I proceed to go back into my room. My sister, unbeknownst to me at the time, peeks out of the basement door and sees a knife on the floor in front of her, freaks out, and calls the cops.  The cops arrive, and they talk to my sister for a very long time, and then they ask me what happened. I told them the story, and they seemed very concerned that I threw a knife. They charge me with a misdemeanor, ""Disorderly Conduct"" and set my court date for today. I learn this later, but apparently my sister had thought that I threw the knife at the basement door as a threat to her, and she was ""Scared for her life and the life of her dog"". The problem is that the cops listened to her story for an hour, and believed someone who has severe mental problems (has been hospitalized, in therapy for over 10 years, on variety of medications, etc).   They listed my father as the ""victim"" however because I was arguing with him. My father is in no way shape or form frightened of me or feels threatened. We hired a lawyer but he told us that since it's a domestic violence case, I should avoid talking about my sister's mental illness at all costs because it could make the family look unstable, and cause the case to drag out longer.  In court today I was essentially told about a protective order (mild, just am not supposed to harass, attack my dad, etc) and that I need a mental health evaluation and anger management courses. Also, this story is in the paper, and if you google my name it comes up, which is absolutely horrible and embarrassing.   My main concern about all of this is that I 1. have absolutely no criminal history 2. The whole reason I was arrested was because they believed my sister who didn't even see me with the knife, wasn't threatened, and is extremely mentally ill 3. the supposed ""victim"" is my dad who is completely on my side and 4. I am supposed to start a job on Monday, but I am absolutely freaking out that I will lose the offer because they will find out about this misdemeanor.   What do I do? I know I have a lawyer and everything, but he says that the news can't be scrubbed until after the case is over, that even if it is dismissed or nolled that it will take 11 months after that to expunge it. He says he can speak to my employer if it raises an issue, but I'm worried they won't want to hire someone who threw a knife at the floor.  Also the police report says I ""waved a knife around"" which literally NOBODY said. My sister, my father, and my mother all told me that they did NOT tell the police this, but somehow now that's in the paper. I'm absolutely horrified that it paints me as some crazy knife waving person when I literally just grabbed an object and threw it in a pissed off moment that has ruined my life and could ruin my career.   My question is, am I doing everything right here? Is there anything I can do to make sure my employer doesn't fire me if they find out about this? Should I legally change my name or something? I'm freaked out because all they have to Google me and this stuff comes up.  Many thanks.  TL;DR: Got into heated argument with my dad, went into the kitchen by myself and threw a knife, sister freaked out when she saw a knife on the ground and called the cops, now my record is sullied and I'm scared I will lose my job that starts in a week",legaladvice

Even if taken to the police station, he should keep repeating that forever until such time he sees an attorney.   And this has nothing to do with his innocence or not.

The last three nights though, when we make plans to 'hang out' she's been breaking them. Normally, I wouldn't mind too much.   The weird thing is, that she breaks the plans to do things she **admits she doesn't want to do.** For instance, last night it was to smoke with a girl that she sort of hangs out with, but doesn't really like. Tonight it was to go drinking with her family and family friends. She doesn't outright break our 'hang out' time plans, but pushes them back till later in the night, and eventually passes out, leaving me waiting.  I feel a bit hurt that she'd rather do stuff she doesn't want to than hang out with me. Am I crazy? Got any advice?",relationshipadvice

d32r5rc,4j0sor,t0talnonsense,"By refusing to keep their dogs contained to a fence, lead, or leash, they are likely breaking the law. Your local PD can tell you whether or not the below statute applies. It doesn't look like it does in Huntsville, but I'm not sure about the rest of Alabama.  &gt; § 3-1-5. Permitting dogs to run at large; applicability of provisions of section in counties and certain cities or towns.  &gt;(a) **Every person owning or having in charge any dog or dogs shall at all times confine such dog or dogs to the limits of his own premises or the premises on which such dog or dogs is or are regularly kept.** Nothing in this section shall prevent the owner of any dog or dogs or other person or persons having such dog or dogs in his or their charge from allowing such dog or dogs to accompany such owner or other person or persons elsewhere than on the premises on which such dog or dogs is or are regularly kept. **Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $2.00 nor more than $50.00.**  You can tell them about this specifically and ask them to keep the dogs off of your property, because they are destroying your property. If you have a security camera, aim it so that you can catch the dogs coming onto your property and destroying your property. You now have evidence when you call the city and report their dogs.  The family is also liable for any damage done by their dogs. If you really wanted to, you could take them to small claims (doesn't require an attorney) and get a judgment against them for the cost of your plants. You would also want video evidence for this course of action as well.  Edit: added more at top in response to /u/OfficerNelson",legaladvice

c1kp17o,g3lcn,Sirwootalot,"Ideally, she should stick up for herself - something along the lines of ""if you're so fucking pathetic that you can't get a girl without threatening them with violence, I seriously suggest you stick to masturbating in the basement until you grow the fuck up and are ready to win them over by being something other than a scumbag."" It'd be intimidating as all hell, and I'd be willing to bet money that they only go with this sick and inhuman way of getting girls because nobody's told them not to.   However, I don't doubt these abortion survivors would put it past themselves to actually hurt her if she did. Is there a way you can contact an administrator at her school and leave an anonymous tip?

con4qst,2w2380,Junkmans1,"Do a little Google research on the terms:  ""exempt"" and ""non-exempt"" as these relate to payroll and salaries.  This will help you understand who must be paid overtime and who is not paid overtime.  Your only option as long as your employer is meeting the legal requirements of who they need to pay overtime compensation to, and the minimum wage, is to either negotiate a better salary or find a new job.  While there are always exceptions, I've found that most promotions and pay changes don't involve huge changes in pay.  Instead they reflect a continuation of minor changes and reflect a shift from one category to the next as your career progresses.  In that regard you have to pay more attention to your overall compensation rather than  your hourly rate.",legaladvice

n44mm,n44mm,baboon2011,"So it all began back in high school. I(20) had a crush on this girl(20) at my grade level.She was part of our circle of friends, but she never knew I had a crush on her.I once asked her out right before graduating and she denied me.Me being the immature little fuck i was back then thought it would be best to just shun her from my life and never make contact with her again, since i thought college would separate us anyways.  During the spring semester of freshman year we both come into contact with each other once more. We started to hang out and began to like each other. I finally get the courage to ask her out(first gf) and she says yes.During out time together, everything was great we were both happy. Unfortunately I was nervous about kissing her and in all honesty I only kissed her once in the entire year we went out.We cuddled and did other things but never have i actually kissed. I feel like this was the downfall of our relationship.During the summer of 2011 she broke up with me.She said that she only saw me as a friend.I was heartbroken. I was occupied with work all summer long and didnt have time to think about her. So barely spoke to her all summer.  At the conclusion of summer she texts me and says that she misses me and we should hang out(as friends) when we start hanging out again, i immediately miss all the fun times i had with her. As the months progress, I find out she likes someone else, but she never even talks about anyone else, so maybe it was just a little crush.She is just so occupied with work sometimes I doubt she even has time to see this other person. It is strange since all she does is talk to me on an everyday basis(at least once a day) We still talk and see each other till this very day, as friends. I want to win her love back. Is there hope or should i just take this as a lesson and move on?  P.S.-There were often times in which she would not see me for weeks due to work.I also work, but i make an effort to go see her. Should i take this as a sign to just move on? She tells my friends she doesnt want to hurt me. I assume this means she wants to just be pals. It would be nice but its just hard being friends with someone who breaks your heart. Is it best that i just forget about her. It may seem as a simple thing to answer, but why am i so conflicted.Why has common sense just flow out the window with this one girl?",relationshipadvice
